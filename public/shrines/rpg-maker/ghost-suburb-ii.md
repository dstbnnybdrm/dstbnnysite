<!-- intro -->

i can't remember exactly how i came across this game, maybe during a
hyperfixated binge of scrolling through games on
[rpgmaker.net](https://rpgmaker.net/) or possibly through some article (that i
can't find at the moment) that mentioned [another game]() by this creator, who
has gone by several names online: publishing this game and others under
[CARRIONBLUE](https://rpgmaker.net/users/CARRIONBLUE/games/), releasing music as
[bilexth](https://soundcloud.com/bilexth), and also going by moga at the same
time, at least from what i understand. i'll continue to refer to them as moga
for brevity!

what ultimately led me to check out the game was its long and interesting title
title: <cite>Ghost Suburb II: From Beyond Sleep into the Eyes of Madness</cite>.
you might be used to indie RPG's having simple, few word titles, <cite>Yume
Nikki</cite> is an obvious one, <cite>OFF</cite> is just three letters, and
<cite>Ib</cite> beats even that with just two. it almost feels like a novel
title and does its job well of piquing intrigue. raising even more questions,
<i>Ghost Suburb II? so where's the first one?</i> well, there isn't one! i
hadn't even downloaded the game yet and already we have a couple mysterious on
hand!

alright, so what's it about at least? well, the game's description says that
it's <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">a game about a nurse in Midland
Research Hospital Center...her name is Okay. she is a insomniac.</q> which seems
straightforward enough, until you read that
<q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">there is a friend named Gertrud, who
pesters her and is a giant floating sphere of darkness with a eye on it</q> and
that <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">it is highly debatable whether
she is in fact a real thing.</q>

upon starting the game you are immediately thrown into an ominous, foreboding
introduction. the text that greets us as guests is skewed and pulses with the
beat of the background music, a despondent voiceover begins but quickly gets
lost in the foggy ambiance.

      title="my guests,
allow me to be courtious--
where this goes, i forget and 
may never know,
but for our sake--
i know that we will never reach the place where
we've heard all there is to tell of these places--
beyond the eyes of madness
and in sleep
where all others go but me"

it's a little unclear where this dialogue comes from but it's a safe assumption
that it is from our main character.

speaking of, after this voiceover gets cut off we are treated to static and then
immediately introduced to her. she tells that she's "Okay", as in, her name is
Okay. except it might not be, and she just assumed so because that's what
everyone has asked her for forever. _sheesh_. it's a small bit of dark, comedic
irony that really sets the tone for this character and also the game in general;
practically every interaction in this game has an underlying dry air of sarcasm
and apathy within them.

she asks if we're "okay", suddenly shifting to a tangent about adulthood, and
how nobody seems to care that she's entered it, shifting again to her ultimate
goal: finding the sleep that seems to elude her.

<!-- music & visuals -->

one of the first things you'll notice about <cite>Ghost Suburb II</cite> is the
incredible soundtrack. when the gameplay itself begins and we're shown the
interior of Okay's room we're also greeted with dark, murky pads, underscoring
what sounds to me like chopped piano samples and other distorted sounds. it's
uneasy, maybe even frightening. all of the music in this game is like this,
sometimes repetitive loops of dark ambiance, sometimes inter-cut with random
sounds, metal clanking?, the occasional breakbeat, etc. ... . moga's music as
bilexth leans towards jungle and other related genres and you can certainly hear
the influence here.

the very next thing you'll notice is the way the entire game looks almost
withered or aged, from the tilesets, to the
<abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr>, down to even the font to an extent. some
bold colour choices, like the blues of Okay's nurse outfit, pierce through the
layer of grunge sitting atop everything. moga's hand-drawn art here is
characteristically cute and sketchy yet carries an uncomfortable feeling with it
somehow, even foregoing some of the more violent things that happen. when a
monster <q>unceremonially</q> bursts through another nurse's stomach near the
start of the game it's the type of illustrated violence that you might see in a
child's notebook, which makes it more uncomfortable in a way.

there's no way around it, this game is _bleak_. ...

<!-- sleep & gertrud -->

Okay's need for sleep is the central focus of this game, presently obvious from
the perpetual eye bags adorning her face. once we're in the game she seems to
give us a reason after inspecting a drawer <q>i can't sleep if i know i have
something to do-- ever</q>. after picking up a "Book of Memories" she tells us
that it's been 3 months since she last slept. what it is she **needs to have
done** in those 3 months we don't know just yet, and it seems that she doesn't
either.

here we're then introduced to Gertrud, the aforementioned floating eye thing who
is, apparently, Okay's only friend, though it certainly doesn't _feel_ like it.
the way they speak to each other is passively hostile, Gertrud in particular
seems to talk down on Okay in a way. their friendship is debatable but it's
clear there's some history between the two. Okay acknowledges how bizarre it is
that this thing is here, speaks to her, follows her around, and chalks it up to
just a recurring hallucination of some kind. but Gertrud disagrees, coaxing us
to take a closer look at her, to touch her and feel that she is indeed real.
still, Okay can't let go of the absurdism of it all and continues to treat her
as a figment of her imagination.

Gertrud seems to want to help and suddenly this hunt for sleep seems to become
quite literal, Okay's dialogue capitalizing "Sleep" as a proper noun, "she needs
to find Sleep in order to force it to give her some sleep". i believe i missed
that detail on my first playthrough, and knowing it changes some contexts.

<!-- medical imagery -->

let's talk about the game's heavy use of medical imagery, which is to be
expected of a game taking place in a hospital. battles are dubbed "operations"
here, your attacks are named things like ..., and ..., when a battle is over
it's .... it kind of reminds me of the
[menhera](https://menheratic.tumblr.com/nav) aesthetic and subculture.

<!-- meta -->

if we could pivot to the developer, moga has been putting their art and
creations out onto the web since even before this game's release. with games
like these it's easy to see how deeply personal they must be to their creators,
again, almost to an uncomfortable point, like you're seeing a bit too much of a
stranger (i will come back to this point soon). on a previous version moga's
site (i believe that the site at the moment is in the progress of a redesign?)
there was a link to an archive of close to their entire body of work that was
posted to Tumblr. included was folders that separated what they called the
different "phases" of their work, of which there were four. here you could see
the growth of an artist over almost a decade, the developmental periods of this
game and other earlier ones, audio files, etc. i mention this because it must be
so unbelievably vulnerable ..
