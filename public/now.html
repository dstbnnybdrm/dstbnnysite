      from my bedroom, of course.

    <h2>making music!</h2>

    <p>
      still working on production and mix with my good friend
      <a rel="external" href="https://mahalslick.carrd.co/">Mahal Slick</a>
      for his upcoming hip-hop and rap EP
      <cite>closed eyes &amp; open ears</cite>! we’re getting pretty close to
      finishing off the major parts of this project and i’m so excited for when
      we can finally share it with everybody!
    </p>

    <p>
      on the side i’m still writing and demoing for my own album, titled
      <cite>orchid rot!</cite>, off of my lofi/emo/noise pop project whose name
      i still haven’t settled on quite yet!
    </p>

    <h2>writing words!</h2>

    <p>
      trying to work on improving my poetry writing in particular! i feel like
      the process surprisingly differs a lot different from (at least
      <em>my</em> approach to) songwriting, and i’d love to get better and
      really learn what makes effective poetry. eventually i’d maybe love to put
      together a tiny poetry zine or something.
    </p>

    <h2>throwing yos</h2>

    <p>
      been playing a lot of yo-yo lately, it’s pretty quickly become a very
      regular part of my life! i carry one with me pretty much anywhere, any
      time i have idle hands i’ll most likely toss one around for a bit, i’ve
      been making up my own tricks and doing weird DIY stuff with them; it’s
      nice having a hobby that’s just a bit more physically involved than any of
      my other ones lol
    </p>

    <h2>media</h2>
