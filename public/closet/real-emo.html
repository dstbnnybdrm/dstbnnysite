      "Real Emo" only consists of the dc Emotional Hardcore scene and the late
      90's Screamo scene. What is known by "Midwest Emo" is nothing but
      Alternative Rock with questionable real emo influence. When people try to
      argue that bands like My Chemical Romance are not real emo, while saying
      that Sunny Day Real Estate is, I can't help not to cringe because they are
      just as fake emo as My Chemical Romance (plus the pretentiousness).

      Real emo sounds ENERGETIC, POWERFUL and somewhat HATEFUL. Fake emo is
      weak, self pity and a failed attempt to direct energy and emotion into
      music.

      Some examples of REAL EMO are Pg 99, Rites of Spring, Cap n Jazz (the only
      real emo band from the midwest scene) and Loma Prieta.

      Some examples of FAKE EMO are American Football, My Chemical Romance and
      Mineral
