      it took a lot longer than i was expecting but the blog is finally up and
      running! and just in time for the new year too!
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      this'll be a place for any random thoughts too long for twitter (not x) or
      anything i feel like rambling about for an extended amount of time. ADHD
      hyperfixations and whatnot.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      for whatever reason i find the act of writing and making it public, even
      in this very nonformal blogpost context, to be very, very vulnerable
      feeling, moreso than any other forms of art i've worked in (visual, music,
      etc.), so this'll also act as a form of practice and, i guess, exposure
      therapy? if you can call it that lol.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      in any case, i'm excited for a new outlet for expression that isn't
      commodified and confined to any social media (although i
      <em>will</em> probably post about this on twitter (not x) oops); a
      personal lil' void to throw whatever i want into. it'll be fun! and
      hopefully freeing and cathartic in a way.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      <i>note that</i>: if you're viewing this on some mobile/smaller screen
      device you might notice there's no list or navigation for the posts
      themselves, and that'll be fixed in the future! i just need to figure out
      a good and mobile friendly way of implementing that since i try to make
      the site as accessible as i can.
