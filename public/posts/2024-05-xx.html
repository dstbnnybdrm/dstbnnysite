    <p class="blog-post__copy">hello again!</p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      i feel like i update this blog a bit less than i want to (although once
      per month isn't terrible, actually!) the last couple of times i sat down
      to write one of these i stopped and wondered if what i'm writing about is,
      i guess, appropriate? in that, i wonder sometimes if i'll be putting a bit
      too much of myself out there onto the internet. it's a thought that i find
      crosses my mind a lot more these days.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      y'know, sometimes i'll come across a blog post on somebody's personal site
      and just sit there kind of dumbstruck and think, "huh, it kind of feels
      like i shouldn't have read that", like i just walked in on some stranger
      by accident. i highly value being vulnerable in my creative
      expression&mdash;which i very much consider this site to be!&mdash;but i
      also don't want to be that person that got walked in with their pants down
      or something lol. there's definitely a balance to be had, i'm just not
      exactly sure where the fulcrum point is.

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      it's just kind of interesting to me because a lot of my favourite art can
      be so painfully intimate, sometimes almost uncomfortably so, and i find
      that i connect with those a lot. there's this concept i've heard people
      describe in poetry and writing, something like: "the more specific
      something is the more universal its appeal", ... . in a lot of respects i
      want to be that kind of artist, to not have to stifle my expression in any
      way, ...
