            i updated the media section of my /now page! and also created this
            feed! what makes it different from the site-log on the site? well, i
            plan to put blog posts here and also bigger updates, more-so site 
            additions, while the site-log is going to continue being very
            granular in its content! stuff you'd probably want to be notified
            about and not, like, me fixing a dumb CSS mistake i missed a month
            ago lol.
