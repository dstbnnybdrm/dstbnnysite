right now i'm currently on the tail end of my week-long term break and a little
bit tipsy lol. initially i had plans to record a bunch of demos for this album
that i'm workshopping, but i never really ended up getting to it.

i saw [this video](https://youtu.be/erwj2_5MlBk?si=yxjJb8JBVMhW7o_t), geared
towards ADHD-havers, on the different kinds of rest—of which there are 7
apparently! (physical, mental, sensory, creative, social, and spiritual) and it
got me reevaluating how i approach my free time, or at least to think about it
more. i've always found it difficult to relax, at least since probably the
back-half of high school? it's hard for me to force myself to do something
leisurely on my own during my free time because i get this feeling a lot in the
back of my mind that i should be doing something creative, and i think this
mostly stems from the limited time i get to do work on creative projects from
being in school and also just a general ADHD tendency some of us have to
hyperfocus and overwork on the things that we're passionate about.

on the types of rest, creative rest was an interesting one to think
about for me (go figure!). from what i gathered from the video, ideal rest
is basically achieved through a **good balance** of all the different
aforementioned aspects; not too much of each and not too little. i think i
always inherently knew that there was a need to rest the creative part of the
mind, but it always felt, i guess, counterintuitive? like, there's this thought
i get a lot that i need to chase and ride out an idea when i get one, otherwise
it'll drift away and i'll forget it forever. while reading a teeny bit on the
subject i found a quote from poet John Ashbery that basically says something to
the effect of <q>wasted time is part of the artistic process</q>, placing
emphasis on the _wasted_ part of that. which i think is ultimately what i
struggle the most with: this kind of lingering guilt i feel whenever indulging
in what feels to me like "wasted time".

i think it's a little funny that i have to remind myself to "waste time" so
often. sometimes sitting down to watch something or to play a game feels almost
taboo to me until i do them, but i tried to lean into those things a bit more
this week instead of working on those demos that, realistically, i can get to
any other time: i listened to some new music (one mentioned above!), played some
games that i haven't touched in a while: some Minecraft, some Hollow Knight
(which i _still_ haven't gotten far into despite how long i've owned it lmao),
et cetera, et cetera. even now, it feels kind of dumb and inconsequential
somehow to be talking about that stuff here, but i guess that's the point!

after finishing this up i'll be going to straight to bed, take care and get some
rest if you need it!
