enjoy yr stay

proof of my existence
take care of yourself!
a <a href="/closet/butterfly.html">butterfly</a> perches itself atop your fingertip
home to <a>Lorna</a>

be yourself, violently, and unabashedly
the internet is dead!
oh, the terror of being <a href="/closet/perception.html">perceived</a>
St. Jack forever and ever
hikikomori hours
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
as long the Earth, Sun, and Moon exist
when you come back i'll still be here
see you at home!
