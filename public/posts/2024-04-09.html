      i just woke up from a brief nap in one of the study areas at my uni
      and&mdash;oh yeah!&mdash;it's the last day of classes for this semester. i
      would normally be in a lecture around this time but we actually finished a
      day early for that class so that time slot is empty now, so i have some
      time to burn while i wait to start this test later.

      the end of a semester always feels a little bit bittersweet to me, even if
      i am
      <em>very</em> excited for it to be over lol. i guess it's just the change
      in routine that happens, you start to grow attached to it after a while,
      at least i do.

      i have a bit of a complicated relationship with academics&mdash;i think
      i'm just kind of over it at this point. i used to like school a lot, i
      love learning and still do, but as i get older and have figured out more
      or less what i would rather spend my life doing, i find myself getting
      more and more, i guess, weary of it? for lack of a better word. so it
      always feels like i have to put my life on pause for a few months once the
      semester starts again, put aside all the projects i've been working on,
      otherwise i start to split my focus between those and school and
      inevitably end up compromising on both. the push-and-pull between school
      and my own creative projects has definitely been tiring me out this
      semester.

      another thing that i've been realising lately (and also lowkey gives me a
      bit of identity crisis lol) is that i don't think i'm
      <em>actually</em> that passionate about computer science. coding and
      programming is only interesting to me so long as i can find ways to use it
      creatively, which is probably why i have pretty much no interest in the
      much more technical topics in computer science like cybersecurity, etc.
      it's not the necessarily the act of programming itself that i'm passionate
      about, it's what i can do with it; i probably wouldn't give a shit about
      whatever a hashmap is otherwise, lmao.

      idk, just some thoughts i've been having about it. i'm excited to get to
      consume all the media i've been putting off. that's all for now, here's a
      short demo of an idea i started putting down the other night:
