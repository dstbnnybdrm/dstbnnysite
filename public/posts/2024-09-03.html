    <p>
      turns out my plan to publish a blog post at least every month didn’t pan
      out, oh well! in the summers between semesters i get this frenetic
      creative energy as i rush to get as many things done before having to go
      back to studying, so unsurprisingly i got caught up in a few things, but
      that’s fine, i’m proud of the work i’ve gotten done in that time!
    </p>

    <p>
      i <em>have</em> been writing though! i’ve actually started a bunch of blog
      posts that i just never got around to finishing or putting up. again, some
      of those were the kind where i stop and wonder if it’s something to be
      putting on a public forum, whoops! but others just kind of fell to the
      side as i had other, more immediate things to work on, especially as some
      of those posts kind of leaned more in an “essay”-ish territory, so i had
      even less time to do (so called) “research”. hopefully you’ll still see
      those at some point!
    </p>

    <p>
      as of today the semester has started again, i’m actually supposed to have
      a tutorial right now but they don’t actually begin until later in the
      month so i figured i’d take the time to write a bit. on
      <a href="https://status.cafe/">status cafe</a> i was poking fun at how i
      wrote more posts while in school vs. during the break from school, which
      is mildly amusing. but it’s just occurring to me now that it’s probably
      because, since i don’t as much time and creative energy to dedicate to
      larger creative projects during the semester, it’s a bit easier to get to
      writing something quick, dumb, and smaller scope like this, especially
      during the larger gaps between classes. so maybe you’ll these more
      regularly again? we’ll see!
    </p>

    <p>
      that being said, i think updates on the site will have to slow down a bit,
      as much as i don’t want to. admittedly i <em>have</em> been slipping a
      teeny bit in my academics, and while that’s mostly because i’m just kind
      of over it at this point and want to work more on my own creative
      projects, i <em>do</em> use this site as a means to procrastinate and get
      that sweet, more immediate gratification lmao. so since i’m getting closer
      and closer to finishing, i feel like i should be locking in more just to
      get things over with. it’s a bit of bummer, there’s a bunch of layout
      changes on the site i want to experiment with, but it’s temporary so
      they’ll just have to wait for now! (but don’t be surprised if i end up
      doing them anyway, oops).
    </p>

    <p>
      anyway, i hope <em>you’re</em> doing well lately! take care, i’d put a
      demo here but i don’t have those files on my school laptop so you’ll just
      have to imagine something super cool and sick and profound, oh wow!

        addendum: omg, how could i forget, it’s a couple days late but it’s now
        been a year since i released my album
        <cite>intrusyve thotz</cite> off my project DREAM DISPHORIA! i’ve
        received a lot of kind words about it and it’s gotten a lot more
        attention than i expected it would, so thanks to you all who’ve
        listened, really &hearts;
      </p>

      <p>
        that project was very different from anything i’d put out before, and
        this next album i’m currently working on will also be completely
        different (what’re gonna do, it’s me!) but DREAM DISPHORIA
        <em>will</em> be returning!
