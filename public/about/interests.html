        i like to think that i have a pretty broad music taste and will probably
        enjoy listening to most things if they're done well, with sincerity and
        intention, or simply just interestingly, but of course i definitely do
        gravitate more towards a select few of my favourite genres/scenes:

          musically i'm very much indebted to emo of all the different waves and
          subgenres, i think there's at least a little bit of emo influence in
          all of my own work, even when i branch out into many different styles.
          i couldn't exactly explain why, but it's a genre and scene that is
          very near and dear to me; i could probably write a dissertation on
          emo. currently, i'm especially excited in seeing all of the creative
          stuff coming out of the latest fifth wave, it's all so varied and
          unique while keeping with the spirit of the genre.

          i'm kind of just lumping these together, they don't have too much in
          common other than a generally lofi or distorted production, sometimes
          a folky/acoustic presentation, and smart, wordy, sometimes
          stream-of-consciousness type lyrics. there's an honesty that's present
          in all of them that i find very captivating.

          i was never super into the metal music that, say, my dad was into and
          so i thought that i was just generally not into "heavy" music. until i
          discovered the visceral, breakdown-laden, scream-yelling vocals type
          of hardcore and beat-down. something about the sheer, apparent
          aggression connected more to me than i guess traditional 90's era
          metal music. and from there, branching out into other subgenres, i
          fell in love with the frenetic, screeching madness of other
          mathcore/sasscore and the like; music that sounds like it's actively
          tearing itself apart.

          maybe it seems strange to lump some of these together? but i think

          bands like
          <i>Sonic Youth</i> and <i>My Bloody Valentine</i> really opened me up
          to using really esoteric guitar tunings and experimenting with all the
          different non-traditional sounds a guitar can make. and bands like
          <i>Number Girl</i> and <i>Jesus and the Mary Chain</i>
          really solidified my love for noise and distortion in their own
          different ways.

          my production and general musical journey starts with EDM, actually.
          initially i was into the kind of "gamer music" you would find in maybe
          some kid's youtube intro (no shade to any of those artists! a lot of
          them are still great!) but later i went on to seek out electronic
          artists that moreso explored emotional qualities in their work. and
          now the current wave of electronic music, starting from
          Soundcloud-borne artists, is really, incredibly inspiring in its
          abundance of creativity.

          jungle and adjacent genres are probably my most recent new love in
          music, i think from a rising appreciation i had of sample-based music
          and a subsequent exploration of 90's rave music, whose iconic synth
          sounds and sample-use i've since fallen in love with. i then
          discovered breakcore, admittedly, from it's recent gen Z–headed boom
          in online popularity (which i almost feel like should have its own
          distinct genre name at this point since it's arguably evolved from its
          initial defining traits), but i find myself leaning more towards the
          "controlled chaos" of breakcore from the early 2000's most days. even
          so, there's still a lot more that i want to explore in the genre!

          i had <em>some</em> experience with RPG Maker games before but i
          really started to delve into them around the height of the COVID-19
          pandemic. among some of the very first i played around this time was
          "Yume Nikki" and that was a special experience that i feel you can
          only really have once; just the atmosphere, the freedom and
          aimlessness, it all culminated into such a unique sense of comfort and
          escapism that i think i really needed at the time.
        </p>

        <p class="body-copy">
          i got into some of the classics shortly after: games like "OFF", "ib",
          "Re:Kinder", etc., all with their own unique blends of horror, the
          surreal, and a tiny bit of tongue-in-cheek self-awareness yet with a
          paradoxically sobering earnestness (wow! what a pretentious string of
          words! lmao). there's a kind of culture or through-line you can see
          when you play a number of RPG Maker games that i just fell in love
          with so immediately; they can feel so intimate and
          personal&mdash;almost to the point of feeling uncomfortably close
          sometimes&mdash;and that's not something you necessarily get a lot
          anywhere else.
