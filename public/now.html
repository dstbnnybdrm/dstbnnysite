      <p class="copy">
        the site right now is currently going through a bit of a redesign, which
        is why it might seem like not much has been happening on it for a while,
        but rest assured i <em>have</em> been working on it relatively
        consistently! i’m liking the direction it’s going in, though it’s not
        that drastic of a change from where it is right now. can’t wait to show
        it off though!

        still working on production and mix with my good friend
        <a rel="external" href="https://mahalslick.carrd.co/">Mahal Slick</a>
        for his upcoming hip-hop and rap EP
        <cite>closed eyes &amp; open ears</cite>! we’re getting pretty close to
        finishing off the major parts of this project and i’m so excited for
        when we can finally share it with everybody!

        on the side i’m still writing and demoing for my own album, titled

      <p class="copy">
        trying to work on improving my poetry writing in particular! i feel like
        the process surprisingly differs a lot different from (at least
        <em>my</em> approach to) songwriting, and i’d love to get better and
        really learn what makes effective poetry. eventually i’d maybe love to
        put together a tiny poetry zine or something.

        been playing a lot of yo-yo lately, it’s pretty quickly become a very
        regular part of my life! i carry one with me pretty much anywhere, any
        time i have idle hands i’ll most likely toss one around for a bit, i’ve
        been making up my own tricks and doing weird DIY stuff with them; it’s
        nice having a hobby that’s just a bit more physically involved than any
        of my other ones lol
