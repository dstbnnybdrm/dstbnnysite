        <p class="copy">
          RPG Maker games are something i only <em>really</em> got into around
          the height of the COVID-19 pandemic but have very quickly fallen in
          love with. among my very first was <i>Yume Nikki</i> and that was a
          special experience that i feel like you can only really have once;
          just the atmosphere, the freedom and the aimlessness, it all
          culminated into such a unique sense of comfort and escapism that i
          think i really needed at the time.
        </p>

        <p class="copy">
          i got into some of the classics shortly after: games like <i>OFF</i>,
          <i>ib</i>, <i>Re:Kinder</i>, etc., all with their own distinct blends
          of horror, the surreal, and a tiny bit of tongue-in-cheek self
          awareness, yet with a paradoxically sobering earnestness. there's a
          kind of culture you can see when you play a number of RPG Maker games
          that i just that i just fell in love with so immediately; they can
          feel so intimate and so personal&mdash;almost to the point of feeling
          uncomfortably close sometimes&mdash;and that's not something you
          necessarily get a lot anywhere else; it's special.
        </p>

        <p class="copy">
          i felt like sharing a few of my favourites and my thoughts and
          experiences with them &hearts;

            it's truly difficult to put into words anything that hasn't been
            said before about this game. i think the easiest and only complete
            way to get a sense of it is to simply

            <i>Yume Nikki</i> seemed to have just popped suddenly into existence
            in 2004, its last official update happening about 3 years later with
            little heard from the game's developer, KIKIYAMA, since. and i think
            the mysteries surrounding <i>Yume Nikki</i>'s creator, coupled with
            its atmosphere and the subject matter itself, add to the allure and
            mystique of the game for a lot of people; by its very nature there
            are open ends everywhere in almost every aspect of this game. it's
            all so fascinating to dig through.

            at first glance it might be unclear why this game has the impact
            that it does on people. when i tell my uninitiated friends about
            <i>Yume Nikki</i> i tell them that it's a game about walking around
            and exploring a dream world, <em>and that's it</em>. i make sure to
            explicitly say that there is no "goal" in the traditional sense,
            save for collecting all the "effects" scattered around the world and
            subsequently achieving the ending ("ending"), which are both
            entirely optional. but, to me, that's <em>why</em>
            <i>Yume Nikki</i> is so special and why it's achieved the devoted
            following that it has. there's a particularly unique blend of
            emotions derived from the game's aimlessness: some parts comforting,
            some uneasy; some parts familiar, some totally alien. there's so
            much that's unexplained but that you know must mean
            <em>something</em>, right? like you've been dropped into somebody's
            subconscious (and, in a way, you have).
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            that open-endedness and lack of direction lends itself to being a
            deeply personal experience for each person that plays it, and is why
            i personally would recommend playing it completely blind, at least
            for the first time. people discover areas in different orders, find
            things in different ways, interpret things differently. it's a joy
            watching somebody play this game and seeing how much their
            experience differs from yours. it almost acts like a Rorschach test
            in a way: what you take away from it is individual to your
            subjective experiences; different things will imprint more onto
            different people. there's a number of

            regarding what exactly is happening and what is trying to be said,
            if anything, sprouting from recurring bits of imagery and general
            themes that people have picked up on.

            because of some of these popular interpretations, and also its
            mostly bleak presentation, i feel like <i>Yume Nikki</i> gets

              >misconstrued as a horror game often</a
            >. it certainly isn't the most optimistic game, at least at a
            surface level: there's a heavy weight of isolation following you as
            you explore this desolate dreamscape on your own, areas like the
            "Number World" that feel almost hostile, and moments that can be

            (mention FACE to a fan and they'll know what you mean), but to label
            it as "horror" feels like a huge undercut, in my opinion.
            <i>Yume Nikki</i> can be scary in the same way it can be scary to be
            alone with your own thoughts; the frightening aspects are less The
            Point of the game and more like a natural outcome to its surreal,
            free associative nature. whatever fear you might derive from it
            might just stem from your own personal ones.

            to me, <i>Yume Nikki</i> instead embodies a strange kind of comfort
            that's hard to articulate. i played it during a particularly
            vulnerable time and it was an experience that was, i guess, healing
            in a way; something about having an entire world to explore at my
            own pace with nothing expected of me, the isolation feeling more
            familiar than uncomfortable. there were a few moments that caught me
            off guard with how resonant they were.

            so there's this area of some forest you can find that's almost pitch
            black, eyes peeking out from deep in the trees that follow your
            movements. a winding pathway is the only thing here, and upon
            following it you're led to this shady area with a lone train car.
            you're able to enter it, and when you do the murky ambiance that's
            been following you around stops immediately, leaving behind just the
            rhythm of the train as it moves (well, supposedly, as you'll see).

            time around some other entity that isn't just mindlessly walking
            about for a brief moment of comfortable silence. but, for as long as

            just a few years after its initial release <i>Yume Nikki</i> rapidly
            became a niche cult classic on the internet, and lately i've seen an
            increase in interest as the culture around "liminal spaces"
            continues to grow. it was so unlike anything else, and still is to
            an extent. the only other comparable piece of media i can think of
            is

              ></i
            >, which was released exclusively in Japan about half a decade
            earlier for the Playstation. let's keep in mind that this was
            developed in <i>RPG Maker 2003</i>, an engine, understandably, known
            for making, well, traditional RPG games! so things like a turn-based
            battle system, maybe a party, a <em>plot</em>, were what was
            expected from a game made with this engine. <i>Yume Nikki</i> came
            along and swept all of those conventions to the side in the interest
            of artistry and expression.
