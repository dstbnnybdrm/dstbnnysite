        i just woke up from a brief nap in one of the study areas at my uni
        and&mdash;oh yeah!&mdash;it's the last day of classes for this semester.
        i would normally be in a lecture around this time but we actually
        finished a day early for that class so that time slot is empty now and i
        have some time to burn while i wait to start this test later.
      </p>

      <p>
        the end of a semester always feels a little bit bittersweet to me, even
        if i am <em>very</em> excited for it to be over lol. i guess it's just
        the change in routine, you start to grow attached to it after a while,
        or at least i do.
      </p>

      <p>
        i've felt my relationship with academia kind of sour over the
        years&mdash;i think i'm a bit over it at this point. i used to like
        school a lot though, i love learning and still do, but as i get older
        and figure out more or less what i would rather spend my life doing, i
        find myself getting more and more, i guess, weary of it? for lack of a
        better word. it always feels like i have to put my life on pause for a
        few months once the semester starts again. i need to put aside all the
        projects i've been working on, otherwise i start to split my focus
        between those and school and inevitably end up compromising on both. the
        push-and-pull between school and my own creative projects and desires
        has definitely been tiring me out this semester. maybe that's a
        pretentious problem to have, maybe it makes sense, i'm not sure.
      </p>

      <p>
        another thing that i've been realising lately (and also lowkey gives me
        a bit of identity crisis) is that i don't think i'm actually
        <em>that</em>
        passionate about computer science. coding and programming is only
        interesting to me so long as i can find ways to use it creatively, which
        is probably why i have pretty much no interest in the much more
        technical topics in computer science like cybersecurity, etc. it's not
        necessarily the act of programming itself that i'm passionate about,
        it's what i can do with it; i probably wouldn't give a shit about
        whatever a hashmap is otherwise, lmao.
      </p>

        okay, some time's past, i just finished that test i was talking about!
        it was really easy, the professor of that class is pretty chill and said
        before that he'd make most of the answers obvious for this last test.
        one of the multiple choice options for, like, the very first question
        was something about collecting all 7 of the Dragon Balls (this is an
        introductory Anthropology class by the way, lmao).
      </p>

      <p>
        anyway, i think another thing weighing over my head the past few months
        is that i haven't had (or given myself) many opportunities to meet other
        people, make new friendships and connections, that sort of thing. not
        that i'm not grateful and appreciative of the friends and relations i
        have now, obviously, i just thought i'd get out of my bubble a little
        more this time around but i guess it didn't pan out as much, oh well!
      </p>

      <p>
        hope this wasn't too much of a downer to read! i've just been reflecting
        a bit on how this semester has felt. i'm still working on some fun
        updates to this site, some music related stuff. still learning how to
        relax a bit. i hope <em>your</em> days have been well! take care, here's
        a little demo idea i recorded a couple of nights ago:
