        i finally finished that Decent Sampler instrument! i sampled the base
        patches of my Casia SA-35/Concertmate-470 toy keyboard and you can find
        it for free
        <a href="/work/samples.html#casio-sa-35" target="_self">right here</a>!
        i'm very proud of how it turned out, making it was quite the learning
        process lol, but i hope i can do more of this kind of thing in the
        future!

        still working very closely on production and mixing with my good friend

        writing for my own album on the side, tentatively titled
        <cite>orchid rot!</cite> off of my lofi and emo-adjacent project dstbnny
        &amp; co.. it's something i've been tossing ideas around for for a while
        and i've been so excited seeing it finally take shape!

        and, as always, i've been periodically updating this site! working on
        some pages for my <a href="/shrines/">shrines</a> page, have ideas for

        right now it feels like the world is trying to get me to replace all of
        my old gear lol. my studio headphones of a few years finally pooped out
        on me, it's gone through a move, cable replacement, tons and tons of
        mixes, etc. i'll have to get a replacement eventually, preferably soon
        as the whole music thing is kind of what i do lol. following that, my
        graphics tablet pen of even longer also died on me (perhaps it was the
        years of literally chucking that thing around??). luckily i managed to
        order a new one on a pretty good sale, and while it'll technically be a
        downgrade i found i never really took advantage of <em>all</em> the
        features my previous one had, so i think i'll be fine (plus it's a lot
        more space-efficient on my desk!).

        still pretty into yoyoing, learned a bunch of easy baby tricks. it's
        been my favourite way to fidget around when i don't have anything to do
        with my hands. unfortunately i now have the urge to buy even more yoyos
        and it feels like it'll be another instrument situation where i'll just
        keep amassing new ones every so often lol (i bought some maraccas at an
        antique store just a few weeks ago).

      <p class="copy">
        as an experiment i bought real metal banjo strings to put on my banjo
        ukulele (or banjolele) and to my surprise it pretty much works (don't
        try it all willy-nilly on any banjo ukulele though, mine just happens to
        work because the neck has a coordinator rod, which not all will have)!
        it's not the most ideal setup, but it certainly isn't terrible. now i'm
        starting to learn some actual tenor banjo playing and i'm
        <em>really</em>
        excited to try and incorporate some of that into my music!
