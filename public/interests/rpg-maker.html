      <h2 class="title">RPG Maker</h2>

      <p class="body-copy">
        RPG Maker games are something i only <em>really</em> got into around the
        height of the COVID-19 pandemic but have very quickly fallen in love
        with. among my very first was "Yume Nikki" and that was a special
        experience that i feel like you can only really have once; just the
        atmosphere, the freedom and the aimlessness, it all culminated into such
        a unique sense of comfort and escapism that i think i really needed at
        the time.
      </p>

      <p class="body-copy">
        i got into some of the classics shortly after: games like "OFF", "ib",
        "Re:Kinder", etc., all with their own unique blends of horror, the
        surreal, and a tiny bit of tongue-in-cheek self awareness, yet with a
        paradoxically sobering earnestness. there's a kind of culture you can
        see when you play a number of RPG Maker games that i just that i just
        fell in love with so immediately; they can feel so intimate and
        personal&mdash;almost to the point of feeling uncomfortably close
        sometimes&mdash;and that's not something you necessarily get a lot
        anywhere else.
      </p>

      <p class="body-copy">
        i felt like sharing a few of my favourites and some words to go along
        with them!
