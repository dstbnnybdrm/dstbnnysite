        <p>
          RPG Maker games are something i only <em>really</em> got into around
          the height of the COVID-19 pandemic but have very quickly fallen in
          love with. among my very first wa <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> and that was
          a special experience that i feel like you can only really have once;
          just the atmosphere, the freedom and the aimlessness, it all
          culminated into such a unique sense of comfort and escapism that i
          think i really needed at the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          i got into some of the classics shortly after: games like
          <i>OFF</i>, <i>ib</i>, <i>Re:Kinder</i>, etc., all with their own
          distinct blends of horror, the surreal, and a tiny bit of
          tongue-in-cheek self awareness, yet with a paradoxically sobering
          earnestness. there’s a kind of culture you can see when you play a
          number of RPG Maker games that i just that i just fell in love with so
          immediately; they can feel so intimate and so personal—almost to the
          point of feeling uncomfortably close sometimes—and that’s not
          something you necessarily get a lot anywhere else; it’s special.
        </p>

        <p>
          i felt like sharing a few of my favourites and my thoughts and
          experiences with them &hearts;

        <p>
          it’s truly difficult to put into words anything that hasn’t been said
          before about this game. i think the easiest and only complete way to
          get a sense of it is to simply
          <a
            href="https://yumenikki.fandom.com/wiki/Yume_Nikki#Yume_Nikki"
            rel="external"

          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> seemed to have just popped suddenly into
          existence in 2004, its last official update happening about 3 years
          later with little heard from the game’s elusive developer, KIKIYAMA,
          since. and i think the mysteries surrounding <cite>Yume Nikki</cite>’s
          creator, coupled with its atmosphere and the subject matter itself,
          add to the allure and mystique of the game for a lot of people; by its
          very nature there are open ends everywhere in almost every aspect of
          this game. it’s all so fascinating to dig through.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          at first glance it might be unclear why this game has the impact that
          it does on people. when i tell my uninitiated friends about
          <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> i tell them that it’s a game about walking
          around and exploring a dream world, <em>and that’s it</em>. i make
          sure to explicitly say that there is no "goal" in the traditional
          sense, save for collecting all the "effects" scattered around the
          world and subsequently achieving the ending ("ending"), which are both
          entirely optional. but, to me, that’s <em>why</em>
          <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> is so special and why it’s achieved the
          devoted following that it has. there’s a particularly unique blend of
          emotions derived from the game’s aimlessness: some parts comforting,
          some uneasy; some parts familiar, some totally alien. there’s so much
          that’s unexplained but that you know must mean <em>something</em>,
          right? like you’ve been dropped into somebody’s subconscious (and, in
          a way, you have).
        </p>

        <p>
          that open-endedness and lack of direction lends itself to being a
          deeply personal experience for each person that plays it, and is why i
          personally would recommend playing it completely blind, at least for
          the first time. people discover areas in different orders, find things
          in different ways, interpret things differently. it’s a joy watching
          somebody play this game and seeing how much their experience differs
          from yours. it almost acts like a Rorschach test in a way: what you
          take away from it is individual to your subjective experiences;
          different things will imprint more onto different people. there’s a
          number of
          <a

            rel="external"
            >fan theories</a
          >
          regarding what exactly is happening and what is trying to be said, if
          anything, sprouting from recurring bits of imagery and general themes
          that people have picked up on.

        <p>
          because of some of these popular interpretations, and also its mostly
          bleak presentation, i feel like <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> gets

            rel="external"
            >misconstrued as a horror game often</a
          >. it certainly isn’t the most optimistic game, at least at a surface
          level: there’s a heavy weight of isolation following you as you
          explore this desolate dreamscape on your own, areas like the “Number
          World” that feel almost hostile, and moments that can be

            >genuinely unsettling</a
          >
          (mention FACE to a fan and they’ll know what you mean), but to label
          it as “horror” feels like a huge undercut, in my opinion.
          <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> can be scary in the same way it can be scary
          to be alone with your own thoughts; the frightening aspects are less
          The Point of the game and more like a natural outcome to its surreal,
          free associative nature. whatever fear you might derive from it might
          just stem from your own personal ones.

          to me,
          <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> instead embodies a strange kind of comfort
          that’s hard to articulate. i played it during a particularly
          vulnerable time and it was an experience that was, i guess, healing in
          a way; something about having an entire world to explore at my own
          pace with nothing expected of me, the isolation feeling more familiar
          than uncomfortable. there were a few moments that caught me off guard
          with how resonant they were.

        <p>
          so there’s this area of some forest you can find that’s almost pitch
          black, eyes peeking out from deep in the trees that follow your
          movements. a winding pathway is the only thing here, and upon
          following it you’re led to this shady area with a lone train car.
          you’re able to enter it, and when you do the murky ambiance that’s
          been following you around stops immediately, leaving behind just the
          rhythm of the train as it moves (well, supposedly, as you’ll see).
          <span id="inside-train-car"
            >inside the train car are empty seats, bar for one taken by a dark,
            red-eyed creature:</span
          >
        </p>

            aria-describedby="inside-train-car"
          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          there’s something a bit sad about this little guy, like they’ve been
          sitting there for as long as this train has been there.
          counterintuitively, leaving now doesn’t do anything, you’d find
          yourself still in the bleak forest you arrived in. it’s only when you
          find a seat—maybe give this guy some company—and sit still for a bit,
          taking in this weird little moment, where you find yourself somewhere
          new upon leaving.
        </p>

        <p>
          maybe that whole sequence was inconsequential to you, but i found
          myself strangely moved by it; it’s one of the rare moments in this
          game where you’re able to mask the isolation for a bit, spend some
          time around some other entity that isn’t just mindlessly walking about
          for a brief moment of comfortable silence. but, for as long as you can
          stay here, you do eventually have to leave—you’ll wake up some time
          anyway. i had many other moments like that struck me in much of the
          same way: flying carelessly through the clouds above a mall, the
          lighthearted melody upon entering a digital-styled world, watching
          over a distant city from a garden in the sky, but i’ll leave those for
          you to discover.

        <p>
          just a few years after its initial release
          <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> rapidly became a niche cult classic on the
          internet, and lately i’ve seen an increase in interest as the culture
          around “<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminal_space_(aesthetic)"
            rel="external"
            >liminal spaces</a
          >” continues to grow. it was so unlike anything else, and still is to
          an extent. the only other comparable piece of media i can think of is
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD:_Dream_Emulator"
            rel="external"
            ><cite>LSD: Dream Emulator</cite></a
          >, which was released exclusively in Japan about half a decade earlier
          for the Playstation. let’s keep in mind that this was developed in
          <cite>RPG Maker 2003</cite>, an engine, understandably, known for
          making, well, traditional RPG games! so things like a turn-based
          battle system, maybe a party, a <em>plot</em>, were what was expected
          from a game made with this engine. <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> came along
          and swept all of those conventions to the side in the interest of
          artistry and expression. its unique influence can be seen across the
          world of indie/underground games like in other more traditional RPGs
          such as OMOCAT’s <cite>OMORI</cite>, <cite>Undertale</cite> by Toby
          Fox (who even managed to
          <a href="https://chartcarr.neocities.org/secretbase_4" rel="external"
            >conduct the first ever interview</a
          >
          with KIKIYAMA!), and even in completely different genres of game such
          as Dan Salvato’s
          <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/7dvb70/comment/dq1dyjb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button"
            rel="external"
            ><cite>Doki Doki Literature Club</cite></a
          >. <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> has even birthed its own subgenre in a way
          with the many
          <a
            href="https://yumenikkifg.fandom.com/wiki/Yume_Nikki_Fangames_Wiki"
            rel="external"
            >fangames</a
          >
          that have been made in the years since its release, building atop of
          the game’s structure and each injecting their own personalities and
          nuances. my personal favourite is
          <a href="https://yume.wiki/flow/Dotflow_Wiki" rel="external"
            ><cite>.flow</cite></a
          >. i might write about some of those sometime too, we’ll see! i could
          yammer on for forever about this game, but there are definitely other
          games that i hold equally dear that i’d love to share!
