      today was my first day returning to university, woo. last year i decided
      to take a semester off because the previous one had burnt me out in a way
      that i've never really experienced before in academia, it kind of took me
      by surprise. i figured i'd use that new free time as an opportunity work
      more on my craft and develop some my creative projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      some of that material i ended up actually finishing and releasing too!
      <i>intrusyve thotz</i> off my project <i>DREAM DISPHORIA</i> was one of
      those as well as the redesign of this site! i'll admit though, it
      <em>does</em> still feel like i wasn't able to get everything i wanted
      finished by the time the new semester rolled around. maybe i was a bit too
      ambitious, but also, i'm constantly jotting ideas down and getting excited
      over new ones; by the time a project is finished there's usually something
      new for me to work on right after.
    </p>

    <p>
      (as an aside i just want to say i'm very, very grateful to all the
      positive reception that the <i>DREAM DISPHORIA</i> project has gotten and
      for all the kind things people have said! it hasn't gotten huge or
      anything but i'm used to throwing these things into the void with no
      fanfare, and while i don't necessarily mind that it's always nice to see
      people enjoy something you've created)
    </p>

    <p>
      despite that i don't even think i ended up relaxing that much over the
      break either lol. it felt like i had a clock over me the whole time, so i
      got it in my head that i needed to spend as much time as possible
      scrambling, trying to finish whatever i could until it was up. maybe
      that's a bit overdramatic (most definitely). i do wish i gave myself a lot
      more breathing room though. allowing yourself the time to consume and
      digest art is as important to being an artist and creator as the act of
      creating itself is, and this is a balance i've always kind of struggled
      with getting right. i think i was consuming the most art when i was going
      through a huge creative block a couple years ago.

    <p>
      but not to make this whole thing to just a long list of pretentious artist
      complaints! i'm still chipping away at my next album, which'll be more of
      a traditional rock-y, guitar-based thing, and i might actually have some
      new, weird
      <i>DREAM DISPHORIA</i>
      material to release in the meantime (emphasis on <em>might</em>!). still
      always excited to be working on stuff!

      anyway, here's a short audio doodle i haphazardly cobbled together the
      other night:
