<!-- intro -->

the <cite>Ghost Suburb</cite> series was brought to the internet in 2013, this
game, <cite>Ghost Suburb II</cite>, still seeing a number of minor updates over
almost 10 years, the last one (at the time of writing) being in 2022. i can't
remember exactly how i came across this game, maybe during a hyperfixated binge
of scrolling through games on [rpgmaker.net](https://rpgmaker.net/) or possibly
through some article (that i can't find at the moment) that mentioned [another
game]() by this creator, who has gone by several names online: publishing this
game and others under
[CARRIONBLUE](https://rpgmaker.net/users/CARRIONBLUE/games/), releasing music as
[bilexth](https://soundcloud.com/bilexth), and also going by moga at the same
time, at least from what i understand. i'll continue to refer to them as moga
for brevity!

there were a few things that ultimately persuaded me to check out the game, one
being its surreal title: <cite>Ghost Suburb II: From Beyond Sleep into the Eyes
of Madness</cite>. to this day i'm still not _exactly_ sure why the series name
is "Ghost Suburb", but it's certainly evocative. and despite being <cite>Ghost
Suburb II</cite> there actually is no "Ghost Suburb I" in the series, which
consists of this game, a [prequel](https://rpgmaker.net/games/5664/) and a
[spinoff](https://gamejolt.com/games/instead-ghost-suburb/3649). the game's
synopsis actually acknowledges this, saying <q
cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">I think I missed a game, but that's
fine. Ghost Suburb I is really special.</q> to my knowledge i don't think we
ever see this <cite>Ghost Suburb I</cite>. perhaps that's significant, but i
suspect that we'll never know for sure.

if you're still wondering what the game is about, moga aptly calls it <q>A RPG
about not sleeping and staring at walls</q>; you could use many words to
describe <cite>Ghost Suburb II</cite>, kind of like what i'm doing right now,
but i honestly don't think i could do it any better than that.

where all others go
-------------------

when you first start the game you are immediately thrown into an ominous and
foreboding introduction, the text that greets us is skewed and pulses with the
clanking beat of the background music, a despondent voiceover beginning but
quickly lost to the foggy ambiance.

and in sleep
where all others go but me"

we're then treated to static, transitioning immediately to our main character,
who's okay! as in, her name is Okay. except, well, it might not be, because she
goes on to say she just assumed so because that's what everyone has asked her
for forever. _sheesh_. it's a small bit of dark, comedic irony that really sets
the tone for this character and also the game in general; practically every
interaction in this game has an underlying dry air of sarcasm or apathy within
them. a lot of the times it's comedic, i find myself chuckling at the dialogue
occasionally, sometimes it isn't.

Okay's need for sleep is the central focus, presently obvious from the perpetual
eye bags adorning her face. <q>i can't sleep if i know i have something to
do&mdash;ever</q>, she laments. it's been 3 months since she last slept. what it
is that she **needs to have done** in those 3 months, we don't know just yet,
and it seems that she doesn't either somehow. later on this hunt for sleep
becomes more literal than you might expect.

we're quickly introduced to Gertrud, our deuteragonist, Okay's only friend, and
apparent <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">giant floating sphere of
darkness with an eye on it</q>. the way these two speak to each other is wrought
with a familiar passive aggressiveness. the game plants doubt to Gertrud's
existence right off the bat&mdash;in the game's synopsis actually. Okay seems to
not want to acknowledge her as anything other than some kind of hallucination,
but Gertrud disagrees; when we first meet her she coaxes Okay to take a closer
look, to touch her, feel that she is indeed real. we're never really privy to
certainty in <cite>Ghost Suburb II</cite>, doubt is planted frequently and the
dreamlike (or nightmarish) nature of the game leaves you in a hazy, liminal
place. the hospital that Okay works in breaks down over the course of the game,
in more ways than the obvious.

surface level
-------------

one of the first things you'll notice about <cite>Ghost Suburb II</cite> is its
original, dark and jungle-inspired soundtrack, which feels almost _hostile_ at
times. when the gameplay itself begins and we're shown the interior of Okay's
room we're also greeted with dark, murky pads, shrouding what sounds to me like
chopped piano samples and other distorted sounds. it's uneasy, maybe even
frightening to some. the other tracks are similar in tone, always coated in this
dark fogginess, occasionally a breakbeat makes its way in but it's always
filtered through this muddy lens.

the very next thing you'll notice is how the game looks. while the colour
choices themselves are bold, like the blues of Okay's outfit and hair or the hot
pink floors of her building, everything from the tileset, to the <abbr
title="user interface">UI</abbr>, down to even the font to an extent looks
withered or aged, with those bright colours just barely piercing through this
layer of grunge. moga's hand-drawn art here is characteristically cute and
sketchy yet carries a certain _feeling_ with it, even foregoing some of the more
violent things that happen. when a monster <q>unceremonially</q> bursts through
another nurse's stomach near the start of the game it's the type of childish
depiction of violence that can make you uncomfortable from the dissonance of it
all.

<!-- medical imagery -->

there's a bunch of medical imagery, which is to be expected for a game taking
place in a hospital. battles are dubbed "operations", attacks are named things
like `x`, and `x`. it kind of reminds me of the
[menhera](https://menheratic.tumblr.com/nav) aesthetic and subculture a little
bit.

meta
----

if we could pivot to the developer, moga has been putting their art and
creations out onto the web since even before this game's release. with games
like these it's easy to see how deeply personal they must be to their creators,
again, almost to an uncomfortable point, like you're seeing a bit too much of a
stranger (i will come back to this point soon). on a previous version moga's
site (i believe that the site at the moment is in the progress of a redesign?)
there was a link to an archive of close to their entire body of work that was
posted to Tumblr. included was folders that separated what they called the
different "phases" of their work, of which there were four. here you could see
the growth of an artist over almost a decade, the developmental periods of this
game and other earlier ones, audio files, etc. i mention this because it must be
so unbelievably vulnerable ..
