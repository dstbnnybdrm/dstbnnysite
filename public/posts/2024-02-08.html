# basitar, Ramiel, and guitar experimentation

<time datetime="2024-02-08">thursday, 08 february 2024</time>

i got my very first electric guitar sometime in, i think, 2017 on my
birthday: a cheap, black and white Squier Stratocaster (the only
left-handed model in our price-range they had at the time) with a used
Line VI Spider amp, i still have both to this day! since then i've
accumulated a not-insignificant amount of instruments, toys, and other
oddities i've managed to get my hands on (maybe i'll write about all of
those sometime). but the topic for this particular post are my electric
guitars! i've gotten two more since then: my trusty Fender Telecaster,
tentatively named "Sunny," and my recent love, my Squier Classic Vibe
Mustang "Langley."

i've gotten _a lot_ of use out of those two instruments in the past
few years, but every once in a while i feel the weight of my neglect for
that very first electric guitar, whom i've now named "Ramiel." admittedly
the electronics on it can leave a little to be desired and so i never felt
the need to use it for recording since the other two guitars usually
suited my purposes a little bit better. but since i had it i felt like i
needed to at least try and find a purpose for it; maybe give it some sort
of a **niche** that i don't currently have filled.

## experiment 01: tunings

the first of my experiments with my Squier Strat was trying out some
tuning shenanigans. i had just gotten into Sonic Youth at the time
and figured i had a safe candidate to try out their tunings on. the one i
stuck with for a while was the tuning for my fav
<abbr title="Sonic Youth">SY</abbr> song, <cite>Schizophrenia</cite>:
`F#F#GGAA`. it has this strange, dissonant, almost ethereal quality to it that
i love. of course, you can't just tune a regular set of guitar strings to
this—well, i guess you can but you'd lose like half of your strings lol—so i
opted to use the closest gauge counterparts that i had lying around from a
standard set: 2 low E's, 2 A's, and 2 G's (note that i had to file down the nut
slots to do this, so proceed with caution if you want to try it!). i left it
like this for a bit and even recorded a dark ambient
[DREAM DISPHORIA song](https://dustbunnybedroom.bandcamp.com/track/complete-dyssociation-we-never-needed-this-body-anyways)
with it (esoteric tunings like this are great for stuff like noise, drone,
ambient, etc.!).

one cool unintended thing about the <cite>Schizophrenia</cite> tuning is that
it's very close to being an "Ostrich tuning," or a "trivial tuning," one
where all the strings are all tuned to the same note. as much as i liked
the dreamy vibe of the <cite>Schizophrenia</cite> tuning i found that i couldn't
find that many uses for it, its particular dissonance was hard to fit into many 
contexts, and would end up leaving the guitar untouched for extended periods of
time again. eventually after fiddling around with the strings again i ended up 
just left it in a trivial G tuning, `GGGggg`. as silly as it might look, giving
myself less notes right off the bat made this guitar _more_ useful to me
somehow. i like the way Yvette Young describes guitar tunings, that they each
kind of "colour" the sound in their own way, in this case i think of it as kind
of like a monochrome palette. i used it to add these super jangly and drone-y
overdubs to some songs by capo-ing at whatever would get me at the song's key
and just fretting a couple strings at the root notes and letting the rest ring
out. if we're still using this colour analogy i guess it'd be like applying a
colour filter on top of the song or a blending mode of some sort.

now, you may have guessed, but Ostrich tuning can be a little bit limiting
to say the least lol. while it was fun for a bit to try and work within
the boundaries of this tuning, there's only so much you can do, and i felt
like it was making the guitar purely one for overdubs, which can't be
right!

## experiment 02: basitar

enter experiment number two! one day i put on a
[youtube video](https://youtu.be/nmAMP7Knm8M?si=_QU6zLw3pze6jlup)
by David Hilowitz (creator of
[Decent Sampler](https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/)!)
where he finds and restores a super decrepit guitar and turns it into a
"basitar." he goes into it in the video, but basically, a regular six string
electric guitar but with two bass strings instead, used famously by Chris Ballew
of the band Presidents of the United States of America. i loved how it sounded
and the guitar in the video being a black Strat-style guitar like mine gave me
an idea. i stripped off all the strings (insert G-string joke) and took the 2
highest strings off of my bass guitar (the D and G strings). the basitar is a
very niche concept, so there isn't really a lot of information on it or how to
set one up. i don't think anyone really says to use the D and G strings of a
bass (instead most people really just said not to do it at all lol), but i
approximated it with what i had compared to what i think are the gauges that
Ballew of
<abbr title="Presidents of the United States of America">POTUS</abbr> uses (he
might have used baritone strings instead, if i recall).

pretty much every instance i've seen of Ballew's basitar, or other people's
imitations, had the bass strings being in the A and G string positions of the
guitar, i.e skipping one string in-between. my guess is that it counteracts the
larger thickness of the strings so they wouldn't be too close together and more
like a bass guitars string distance. after just slapping the strings onto the
guitar i was surprised at how well it took the much higher gauges. they were
pretty much playable immediately, to a certain extent, and with some simple
adjustments it was a pretty decent playing guitar! or, uh, basitar! the
filed-down nut slots i had already done for the SY tuning were actually already
pretty close to what i needed for these new strings to fit snug. the way bass
strings feel on a standard six string guitar is also surprisingly different. the
shorter scale-length makes frets easier to reach, of course, but there's a kind
of extra "thumpiness" (?) there that i love and kind of reminds me of, say, a
Fender Mustang bass. the tuning i went with was `DA` (half-step higher from what
POTUS used) so it actually occupies the same range as a normal guitar in drop D,
but the bigger string gauges give the sound much more weight and also kind of 
counteracts the thinner sounding electronics. i loved how it felt and sounded
and how it was just limiting enough to feel creative in without being _too_
stifling!

## experiment 03: Ramiel ##

one of the things i like about bass strings is that, to me, it feels a lot
easier to tap on them. i guess something about the larger gauges makes
them easier to ring out when tapped? and this applies to the basitar as
well! but then that got me thinking about twinkly emo and math rock (well,
i guess i'm always thinking about twinkly emo and math rock), and then _that_
gave me another idea. what if i add just one more string? a regular unwound
guitar string, so i could some interesting juxtaposition between the meaty low
bass string sound and also some twinkly high stuff.

so i took an extra high E string i had and strung it in the B position, right
next to the (now) A string. i tried it in the actual high E position first, and
it definitely worked, but i actually preferred the closer proximity to the A
string. since the D and A strings are further apart, if the high E and A strings
are closer you can actually fret both of them with a barre without touching the
low D. and since E and A are a fifth apart you get a power chord really easily
without touching the D string (and of course, D and A also make a power chord,
so there's two ways to get two very different sounding power chords here!). i
left the high E string as an E, so now the tuning is: `DAe`, coincidentally half
of the famous [American Football](https://youtu.be/X1CZMxosvhk?si=wzk5UhGnAzT3LECQ) tuning: `DAEac#e`. man, i love emo. at this point was when i named the guitar 
"Ramiel" (don't ask me why, i'm not even entirely sure, i'm just a loser <cite>Evangelion</cite> fan lmao).

## aftermath! ##

in effect, i basically took the already niche idea of a basitar and altered it
even more to fit my personal needs, and i might be the only person to have tried
this particular setup? at least from looking around online, i'm sure _somebody_
out there has to have done something similar.

i've always operated under the assumption that when i buy a guitar, or any
instrument, it's mine to keep forever. there's obviously times where you might
need to sell one, but i never really operate under the assumption that i will
some day, so i don't worry about things like how the resell value gets affected
by doing X or Y to one. i think you should make your instruments **unabashedly
yours**! cover them in stickers, give them silly names, do all sorts of weird
stuff and modifications to them (as long as you know what you're doing),
whatever is gonna connect you to your instrument more and make it easier to
express yourself on them!

this was fun to do and write about! i might get into my other instruments some
day, maybe one on my Squier Mustang and the process of turning it from right to
left-handed?
