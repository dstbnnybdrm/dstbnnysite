      you can probably guess that i spend a not-insignificant time sitting at a
      desk using a keyboard just about every day. i'm doing it right now to type
      this up! i'm in a Computer Science degree and it's pretty much
      <em>all</em> we do! so over the years i've discovered and learned ways to
      make the typing experience easier and less painful for myself and it's
      resulted in a setup that people tell me is pretty unusual. i think most of
      us these days probably type more than write, so it's worth talking about!
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      important things out of the way first, i have amniotic band syndrome! it
      mostly affects my hands and fingers, my left hand moreso than my right. i
      won't be sharing any photos or anything, i'm honestly still a little bit
      self-conscious about it appearance-wise, but i've been trying to work on
      that more by talking about it more, such as right now! this makes some
      things designed for most people with, er, "normal" hands a little
      difficult for me to use, especially when the symmetry of both hands are
      taken into account in their design and use, which is probably most things
      that utilise both hands, keyboards included!

        the traditional QWERTY layout
      </figcaption>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      the design choices of the modern keyboard still largely take after the
      limitations of the typewriter. it's why the rows on a standard keyboard
      are staggered: to account for the arms on an actual typewriter that would
      actually place the letters onto the page. we've just kept these around
      because of tradition; everyone was already used to it, so why change it
      now? the way that the standard QWERTY layout came about is actually still
      under some debate. a lot of people seem to believe that it was designed
      specifically to slow down typists so they would jam typewriters less, but
      that's been disproved. although it is true that it prevented jamming
      because the frequently used keys are placed further apart.
    </p>

    <h3 class="blog-post__heading">part 1: QWERTY is mean to me</h3>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      now onto me! i didn't learn to type "properly", i.e touch type, until just
      a few years ago, honestly. i don't exactly remember how i used to do it
      but i remember that for my left hand it relied heavily on just pinky and
      index finger and my thumb also for hitting regular keys (which is usually
      designated to just the spacebar whet touch typing). my ring finger is
      significantly shorter than what's typical and the way my middle finger is
      made using it to type was uncomfortable at first, so i didn't!
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      eventually i started to feel the years of typing like a maniac come back
      to haunt me through my wrists and it was especially bad for that left hand
      i keep bringing up. actually, that's one the issues with QWERTY: it
      doesn't distribute use between both hands, and even fingers, evenly. in
      fact, it has a bias towards the left hand where thousands of words are
      typed with just the left side of the keyboard. maybe that's an advantage
      to all the lefties out there? but for me, it was pretty bad. since i was
      only using three of the five fingers on my left hand it put additional
      strain on those fingers, and since i was using my thumb to reach regular
      keys that would normally be out of reach with it if i was following home
      row, it put strain there too, especially because i was curling it under my
      hand to reach keys like 'z', 'x', and 'c'.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      a few years ago it started to get particularly worse, especially since it
      was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and schooling had to be
      moved online. i get paranoid a lot about losing physical abilities like in
      my hands, sight, or ears, and how that would affect my being able to
      function and create, so i decided it was time to finally throw out those
      bad habits and learn to touch type! i would have time anyway since this
      when i took a semester off from university. i used a handful of resources
      to learn but i think one of the most helpful was
      <a rel="external" href="https://www.keybr.com/">keybr</a>, which starts
      you out with just a few letters, adding more the more you improve,
      adapting by adding more of the things you particularly struggle with,
      eventually getting to real words.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      i actually picked up touch typing pretty quickly and was a lot faster and
      more comfortable than i was before. however, those issues with the left
      hand never really left, and i was still getting pains in my wrists.
      another problem with QWERTY that i kind of alluded to before is it spreads
      out the most used letters across the keyboard, largely not on the home row
      where your fingers should start in. the most used letter, 'e', is a row
      home row position, some of the most common consonants, 't', 'n', 's', etc.
      are scattered across the keyboard, most also not on the home row but up
      and down and all over the place (don't get me started on the semicolon of
      all things being on home row). combine this with the fact that so many
      words use the left hand primarily in QWERTY and my hands were still not
      happy.

        the Dvorak layout
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      enter Dvorak! Dvorak is keyboard layout actually created way back in 1934
      as a more ergonomic alternative to QWERTY, aiming to address some of the
      issues with QWERTY that i'd mentioned above. nowadays it actually comes
      included with every major OS! i imagine that to someone seeing this layout
      for the first time it probably looks like some gibberish nightmare, but
      the letter placement is actually very purposeful! first, note that all of
      the vowels have now been moved to the left side of the keyboard. the
      general rule (in English) is that words _have_ to have a vowel, so what
      this does is it ensures that pretty much every word (in English) requires
      alternating between both of your hands, lessening the strain put on both.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      another cool thing is that for common sequences of letters that do occur
      on one hand, the order in which they occur generally goes from the outer
      fingers to the inner fingers (so pinky, ring, middle, and so on), like
      you're drumming your fingers on a desk. this is easier for us for some
      reason, so it makes typing words like "the" very natural and satisfying.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      and of course, the way the letters are distributed means that your fingers
      pretty much stay in home row position the majority of the time, reducing
      the amount of jumping around your hands have to do significantly.

      is a really good visual aid in showing the differences between QWERTY and
      Dvorak and also Colemak, another alternative to QWERTY!
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      i was understandably hesitant to learn Dvorak at first, it makes no
      attempt at making the least amount of changes from QWERTY unlike other
      alternate keyboard layouts, and i'd heard accounts from people who've
      learned Dvorak that their ability to type on QWERTY had worsened
      significantly, much like slowly forgetting a language that you stop using.
      but i made it a fun challenge for myself, and if it didn't pan out then,
      well, i'd already learned QWERTY properly! luckily many touch type
      learning sites already have a mode for Dvorak, but if you just want to
      test out the waters and try it out then [learn.dvorak.nl] is a great site
      to use as it can handle converting the keyboard mapping for you so you
      don't need to change the layout in your system just yet. after some time
      with that site i actually switched back to practicing on keybr again since
      it also allows for Dvorak.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      in the beginning i felt the need to have to switch back and forth between
      QWERTY and Dvorak (i believe most OSs have an easy way to do this via
      shortcuts!), only using Dvorak during those practicing sessions since i
      was so much slower on it at first. after some time however i noticed i
      would be trying to type in Dvorak while still on QWERTY and vice versa.
      it's a difficult decision to have to commit, especially since i'd be
      losing some proficiency in QWERTY that i'd already built up. but i was
      feeling very comfortable in Dvorak.
