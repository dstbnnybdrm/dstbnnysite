      you can probably guess that i spend a not-insignificant time sitting at a
      desk using a keyboard just about every day. i'm doing it right now to type
      this up! i'm in a Computer Science degree and it's pretty much
      <em>all</em> we do! so over the years i've discovered and learned ways to
      make the typing experience easier and less painful for myself and it's
      resulted in a setup that people tell me is pretty unusual. i think most of
      us these days probably type more than write, so it's worth talking about!
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      important things out of the way first, i have amniotic band syndrome! it
      mostly affects my hands and fingers, my left hand moreso than my right. i
      won't be sharing any photos or anything, i'm honestly still a little bit
      self-conscious about it appearance-wise, but i've been trying to work on
      that more by talking about it more, such as right now! this makes some
      things designed for most people with, er, "normal" hands a little
      difficult for me to use, especially when the symmetry of both hands are
      taken into account in their design and use, which is probably most things
      that utilise both hands, keyboards included!

        the traditional QWERTY layout
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      the design choices of the modern keyboard still largely take after the
      limitations of the typewriter. it's why the rows on a standard keyboard
      are staggered: to account for the arms on an actual typewriter that would
      actually place the letters onto the page. we've just kept these around
      because of tradition; everyone was already used to it, so why change it
      now? the way that the standard QWERTY layout came about is actually still
      under some debate. a lot of people seem to believe that it was designed
      specifically to slow down typists so they would jam typewriters less, but
      that's been disproved. although it is true that it prevented jamming
      because the frequently used keys are placed further apart.
    </p>

    <h3 class="blog-post__heading">part 1: QWERTY is mean to me</h3>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      now onto me! i didn't learn to type "properly", i.e touch type, until just
      a few years ago, honestly. i don't exactly remember how i used to do it
      but i remember that for my left hand it relied heavily on just pinky and
      index finger and my thumb also for hitting regular keys (which is usually
      designated to just the spacebar whet touch typing). my ring finger is
      significantly shorter than what's typical and the way my middle finger is
      made using it to type was uncomfortable at first, so i didn't!
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      eventually i started to feel the years of typing like a maniac come back
      to haunt me through my wrists and it was especially bad for that left hand
      i keep bringing up. actually, that's one the issues with QWERTY: it
      doesn't distribute use between both hands, and even fingers, evenly. in
      fact, it has a bias towards the left hand where thousands of words are
      typed with just the left side of the keyboard. maybe that's an advantage
      to all the lefties out there? but for me, it was pretty bad. since i was
      only using three of the five fingers on my left hand it put additional
      strain on those fingers, and since i was using my thumb to reach regular
      keys that would normally be out of reach with it if i was following home
      row, it put strain there too, especially because i was curling it under my
      hand to reach keys like 'z', 'x', and 'c'.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      a few years ago it started to get particularly worse, especially since it
      was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and schooling had to be
      moved online. i get paranoid a lot about losing physical abilities like in
      my hands, sight, or ears, and how that would affect my being able to
      function and create, so i decided it was time to finally throw out those
      bad habits and learn to touch type! i would have time anyway since this
      when i took a semester off from university. i used a handful of resources
      to learn but i think one of the most helpful was
      <a rel="external" href="https://www.keybr.com/">keybr</a>, which starts
      you out with just a few letters, adding more the more you improve,
      adapting by adding more of the things you particularly struggle with,
      eventually getting to real words.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      i actually picked up touch typing pretty quickly and was a lot faster and
      more comfortable than i was before. however, those issues with the left
      hand never really left, and i was still getting pains in my wrists.
      another problem with QWERTY that i kind of alluded to before is it spreads
      out the most used letters across the keyboard, largely not on the home row
      where your fingers should start in. the most used letter, 'e', is a row
      home row position, some of the most common consonants, 't', 'n', 's', etc.
      are scattered across the keyboard, most also not on the home row but up
      and down and all over the place (don't get me started on the semicolon of
      all things being on home row). combine this with the fact that so many
      words use the left hand primarily in QWERTY and my hands were still not
      entirely satisfied.

      part 2: Dvorak, QWERTY's snobby little brother

        the Dvorak layout
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      enter Dvorak! Dvorak is keyboard layout actually created way back in 1934
      as a more ergonomic alternative to QWERTY, aiming to address some of the
      issues with QWERTY including the ones that i'd mentioned above. nowadays
      it actually comes included with every major OS! i imagine that to someone
      seeing this layout for the first time it probably looks like some
      gibberish nightmare, and for the gamers out there seeing ",AOE" instead of
      WASD might've given you an aneurysm, but the letter placement is actually
      <em>very</em> purposeful!
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      notice that all of the vowels have now been moved to the left side of the
      keyboard. the general rule (in English) is that words have to have a
      vowel, so what this does is it ensures that pretty much every word (in
      English) requires alternating between both of your hands, lessening the
      strain and fatigue put on both. notice too that all the vowels are right
      at home row, comfortably right at reach whenever needed. actually, most of
      the most common letters and letter combinations are placed at home row
      meaning that your fingers pretty much stay at home row position the
      majority of the time, reducing the amount of jumping around your hands
      have to do significantly.

      is a really good visual aid in showing the differences in finger movement
      between QWERTY and Dvorak! (and also Colemak, another alternative to
      QWERTY)
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      a short little aside, but people tend to write off Dvorak by stating the
      fact that it was shown to not be significantly faster than QWERTY (and
      it's not!), but here's the thing: speed is not the only aspect of typing,
      and i'm not sure why words per minute is the only thing some people will
      fixate on.

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      i was hesitant to learn Dvorak at first. it makes no attempt at making the
      least amount of changes from QWERTY unlike other alternate keyboard
      layouts like Colemak and Workman but Dvorak comes pre-installed on every
      OS while those other alternatives don't, and i didn't feel like going
      through the trouble of having to download a new layout. so i took it as a
      fun little challenge, and if it didn't pan out, well, i've already learned
      QWERTY! luckily many touch type learning sites already have a mode for
      Dvorak, but if you just want to test out the waters and try it out like i
      did then
      <a rel="external" href="https://learn.dvorak.nl/" target="_blank"
        >learn.dvorak.nl</a
      >
      is a great site to use as it can handle converting the keyboard mapping
      for you so you don't need to change the layout in your system just yet.
      after some time with that i actually switched back to practicing on keybr
      again since it also allows for Dvorak.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      the middle stages of learning a new layout is strange feeling. at first i
      was switching back and forth between QWERTY and Dvorak, only really using
      Dvorak when practicing it, but the two started to blend in my head and i'd
      be trying to type in one while still in the other. it can be kind of scary
      to commit to a new layout, i've heard accounts of people significantly
      losing proficiency in QWERTY after learning Dvorak like how you might
      slowly forget a language after not using it for a while. i took the risk
      though and i haven't looked back since, honestly! typing has been
      <em>so</em> comfortable ever since.
