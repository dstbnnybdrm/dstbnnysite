      man, this month has been surprisingly exhausting as everything is starting
      to wrap up this semester! i'm typically pretty bad at keeping up with
      habits during busy times like this so i haven't given myself many
      opportunities to write a lot. i know, ironic considering my last post was
      about rest!
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      i got older some time this month! my mom kept asking me if i wanted to do
      anything special for it but i'm not usually one for grand, bustling
      celebrations and stuff like that, so it was just a relatively chill day;
      we ate out, my dad and i spontaneously bought a ukulele banjo when we were
      only meant to get guitar strings lol.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      i've been wanting an actual banjo for a while, i think it's a beautiful
      instrument with a rich history, but the ukulele banjo is close behind (and
      cheaper!) and has its own qualities that set it apart from both a ukulele
      and a banjo. it's been fun toying around with that thing, it has a unique
      timbre i've never really had access to before, so it's been interesting
      trying to incorporate it into my songwriting.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      other than that, i added a
      <a rel="external" href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank"
        >/now</a
      >
      page to the site, inspired by
      <a rel="external" href="https://sive.rs/now" target="_blank"
        >Derek Sivers</a
      >! i really liked the concept: a high level, bigger picture look at your
      life, currently. if we have pages
      <a href="/?=p/about/" target="_parent">about</a> ourselves personally then
      why not a page about how we've been lately? so that's there now, and it'll
      be updated every once in a while!
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      i'm also currently reworking my
      <a href="/?p=/about/interests" target="_parent">interests</a> page to be
      it's own thing and have its own sub-pages and stuff so i'll have more room
      to ramble on about the things i love and hyperfixate over! it'll be fun.
      i've been trying to think of an interesting, quirky name for it other than
      just "interests" but that's what it is right now lol. i've also been
      throwing around ideas for a landing page and possibly rearranging and
      adding some stuff to the main layout, but knowing myself, if i don't keep
      at things one at a time then nothing'll get finished, so that's my current
      focus for now on the site!
    </p>

      i've also been trying to improve at poetry-writing in particular. it's a
      bit difficult because poetry can be, to me, an especially
      vulnerable-feeling medium, and at the same time it can be really easy to
      sound (and i don't like using this word often, but) cringe, to say the
      least. my writing also tends to lean towards being a little macabre and
      surreal, which can be hard for me to judge objectively, if that makes any
      sense. but it's something i really want to get better at, because it can
      be a very powerful and moving medium, and i really do love writing despite
      how embarrassing it still feels.

      that should be it for now, mostly. there's not much else notable going on,
      just trying to make it through this semester, and going into details there
      would be <em>very</em> boring and probably amount to just a list of
      complaints. so i hope this month has been good to you, and if not, i hope
      the next will be better! take care, you deserve it! here's a little audio
      doodle i recorded the other day:
