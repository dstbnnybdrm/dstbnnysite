          RPG Maker games are something i only <em>really</em> got into around
          the height of the COVID-19 pandemic but have very quickly fallen in
          love with. among my very first was <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> and that
          was a special experience that i feel like you can only really have
          once; just the atmosphere, the freedom and the aimlessness, it all
          culminated into such a unique sense of comfort and escapism that i
          think i really needed at the time.
        </p>

        <p class="copy">
          i got into some of the classics shortly after: games like
          <cite>OFF</cite>, <cite>ib</cite>, <cite>Re:Kinder</cite>, etc., all
          with their own distinct blends of horror, the surreal, and a tiny bit
          of tongue-in-cheek self awareness, yet with a paradoxically sobering
          earnestness. there's a kind of culture you can see when you play a
          number of RPG Maker games that i just that i just fell in love with so
          immediately; they can feel so intimate and so personal&mdash;almost to
          the point of feeling uncomfortably close sometimes&mdash;and that's
          not something you necessarily get a lot anywhere else; it's special.
        </p>

            it's truly difficult to put into words anything that hasn't been
            said before about this game. i think the easiest and only complete
            way to get a sense of it is to simply

            <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> seemed to have just popped suddenly into
            existence in <time datetime="2004">2004</time>, its last official
            update happening about 3 years later with little heard from the
            game's developer, KIKIYAMA, since. and i think the mysteries
            surrounding <cite>Yume Nikki</cite>'s creator, coupled with its
            atmosphere and the subject matter itself, add to the allure and
            mystique of the game for a lot of people; by its very nature there
            are open ends everywhere in almost every aspect of this game. it's
            all so fascinating to dig through.

            at first glance it might be unclear why this game has the impact
            that it does on people. when i tell my uninitiated friends about
            <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> i tell them that it's a game about walking
            around and exploring a dream world, <em>and that's it</em>. i make
            sure to explicitly say that there is no "goal" in the traditional
            sense, save for collecting all the "effects" scattered around the
            world and subsequently achieving the ending ("ending"), which are
            both entirely optional. but, to me, that's <em>why</em>
            <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> is so special and why it's achieved the
            devoted following that it has. there's a particularly unique blend
            of emotions derived from the game's aimlessness: some parts
            comforting, some uneasy; some parts familiar, some totally alien.
            there's so much that's unexplained but that you know must mean
            <em>something</em>, right? like you've been dropped into somebody's
            subconscious (and, in a way, you have).
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            that open-endedness and lack of direction lends itself to being a
            deeply personal experience for each person that plays it, and is why
            i personally would recommend playing it completely blind, at least
            for the first time. people discover areas in different orders, find
            things in different ways, interpret things differently. it's a joy
            watching somebody play this game and seeing how much their
            experience differs from yours. it almost acts like a Rorschach test
            in a way: what you take away from it is individual to your
            subjective experiences; different things will imprint more onto
            different people. there's a number of

            regarding what exactly is happening and what is trying to be said,
            if anything, sprouting from recurring bits of imagery and general
            themes that people have picked up on.

            surface level: there's a heavy weight of isolation following you as
            you explore this desolate dreamscape on your own, areas like the
            "Number World" that feel almost hostile, and moments that can be

            (mention FACE to a fan and they'll know what you mean), but to label
            it as "horror" feels like a huge undercut, in my opinion.
            <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> can be scary in the same way it can be scary
            to be alone with your own thoughts; the frightening aspects are less
            The Point of the game and more like a natural outcome to its
            surreal, free associative nature. whatever fear you might derive
            from it might just stem from your own personal ones.

            to me, <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> instead embodies a strange kind of
            comfort that's hard to articulate. i played it during a particularly
            vulnerable time and it was an experience that was, i guess, healing
            in a way; something about having an entire world to explore at my
            own pace with nothing expected of me, the isolation feeling more
            familiar than uncomfortable. there were a few moments that caught me
            off guard with how resonant they were.

            so there's this area of some forest you can find that's almost pitch
            black, eyes peeking out from deep in the trees that follow your
            movements. a winding pathway is the only thing here, and upon
            following it you're led to this shady area with a lone train car.
            you're able to enter it, and when you do the murky ambiance that's
            been following you around stops immediately, leaving behind just the
            rhythm of the train as it moves (well, supposedly, as you'll see).

            time around some other entity that isn't just mindlessly walking
            about for a brief moment of comfortable silence. but, for as long as

            just a few years after its initial release
            <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> rapidly became a niche cult classic on the
            internet, and lately i've seen an increase in interest as the
            culture around "liminal spaces" continues to grow. it was so unlike
            anything else, and still is to an extent. the only other comparable
            piece of media i can think of is

              ></i
            >, which was released exclusively in Japan about half a decade
            earlier for the Playstation. let's keep in mind that this was
            developed in <cite>RPG Maker 2003</cite>, an engine, understandably,
            known for making, well, traditional RPG games! so things like a
            turn-based battle system, maybe a party, a <em>plot</em>, were what
            was expected from a game made with this engine.
            <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> came along and swept all of those
            conventions to the side in the interest of artistry and expression.

            the game's structure and each injecting their own personalities and
            nuances. my personal favourite is

            i could yammer on for forever about this game, but there are
            definitely other games that i hold equally dear that i'd love to
            share!

            i can't remember exactly how i came across this game, maybe during a
            hyperfixated binge of scrolling through games on
            <a rel="external" href="https://rpgmaker.net/">rpgmaker.net</a> or
            possibly through some article (that i can't find at the moment) that
            mentioned <a rel="external" href="">another game</a> by this
            creator, who has gone by several names online: publishing this game
            and others under
            <a
              rel="external"
              href="https://rpgmaker.net/users/CARRIONBLUE/games/"
              >CARRIONBLUE</a
            >, releasing music as
            <a rel="external" href="https://soundcloud.com/bilexth">bilexth</a>,
            and also going by moga too (at least from what i understand, and i
            myself can't knock someone for having
            <a href="/work/music.html">many aliases</a>). i'll continue to refer
            to them as moga for brevity!

          <p class="copy">
            what i can say that is that i was immediately drawn in by the game's
            almost comically yet long evocative title.
            <cite
              >Ghost Suburb II: From Beyond Sleep into the Eyes of Madness</cite
            >, what on earth could that possibly be about? well, the game's
            description calls it
            <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/"
              >a game about a nurse in Midland Research Hospital Center, in the
              middle of a Hospital Zone&mdash;her name is Okay. she is a

          <p class="copy">
            it's not a terribly well-known RPG Maker game, which i think is such
            a shame, though it has received some recognition among RPG Maker
            fans and a small, niche following.
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            the look of this game seems almost withered and aged while some
            select bold colour choices, like of our main character Okay, pierce
            through the layer of grunge that sits atop everything. moga's
            hand-drawn art here is characteristically cute and sketchy yet
            carries an uncomfortable feeling with it somehow; when a monster
            bursts through a nurse's stomach
            <q>unceremonially</q> near the start of the game it's the type of
            illustrated violence that you might see in a child's notebook. it
            gives an air of a loss of innocence, in a way.

            when i discovered and played Ghost Suburb II it was almost 10 years
            after its initial release in
            <time datetime="2013">2013</time>.

            if we could pivot to the developer, moga has been putting their art
            and creations out onto the web since even before this game's
            release. with games like these it's easy to see how deeply personal
            they must be to their creators, again, almost to an uncomfortable
            point, like you're seeing a bit too much of a stranger (i will come
            back to this point soon). on a previous version moga's site (i
            believe that the site at the moment is in the progress of a
            redesign?) there was a link to an archive of close to their entire
            body of work that was posted to Tumblr. included was folders that
            separated what they called the different "phases" of their work, of
            which there were four. here you could see the growth of an artist
            over almost a decade, the developmental periods of this game and
            other earlier ones, audio files, etc. i mention this because it must
            be so unbelievably vulnerable ..

            i yearn to create something that makes somebody feel just a sliver
            of what this game made me.
