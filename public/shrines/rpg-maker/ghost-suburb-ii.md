<!-- intro -->

i can't remember exactly how i came across this game, maybe during a
hyperfixated binge of scrolling through games on
[rpgmaker.net](https://rpgmaker.net/) or possibly through some article (that i
can't find at the moment) that mentioned [another game]() by this creator, who
has gone by several names online: publishing this game and others under
[CARRIONBLUE](https://rpgmaker.net/users/CARRIONBLUE/games/), releasing music as
[bilexth](https://soundcloud.com/bilexth), and also going by moga at the same
time, at least from what i understand. i'll continue to refer to them as moga
for brevity!

i think what ultimately led me to check out the game was its long and
interesting title title: <cite>Ghost Suburb II: From Beyond Sleep into the Eyes
of Madness</cite>. you might be used to indie RPG's having simple, few word
titles, <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> is an obvious one, <cite>OFF</cite> is just
three letters, and <cite>Ib</cite> beats even that with just two. it almost
feels like a novel title and did its job well of piquing my interest.

<!-- alright, so what's it about at least? well, the game's description says that -->
<!-- it's <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">a game about a nurse in Midland -->
<!-- Research Hospital Center...her name is Okay. she is a insomniac.</q> which seems -->
<!-- straightforward enough, until you read that -->
<!-- <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">there is a friend named Gertrud, who -->
<!-- pesters her and is a giant floating sphere of darkness with a eye on it</q> and -->
<!-- that <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">it is highly debatable whether -->
<!-- she is in fact a real thing.</q> -->

upon starting the game you are immediately thrown into an ominous and foreboding
introduction. the text that greets us is skewed and pulses with the clanking
beat of the background music, a despondent voiceover begins but quickly gets
lost in the foggy ambiance.

then we're treated to static and immediately introduced to our main character.
she tells that she's "okay", as in, her name is Okay. except it might not be,
because she goes on to say she just assumed so because that's what everyone has
asked her for forever. _sheesh_. it's a small bit of dark, comedic irony that
really sets the tone for this character and also the game in general;
practically every interaction in this game has an underlying dry air of sarcasm
and apathy within them, a lot of the times it's comedic, sometimes it isn't.

<!-- she asks if we're "okay", suddenly shifting to a tangent about adulthood, and -->
<!-- how nobody seems to care that she's entered it, shifting again to her ultimate -->
<!-- goal: finding the sleep that seems to elude her. -->

<!-- music & visuals -->

one of the first things you'll notice about <cite>Ghost Suburb II</cite> is the
dark, jungle-inspired soundtrack; it feels almost hostile at times. when the
gameplay itself begins and we're shown the interior of Okay's room we're also
greeted with dark, murky pads, shrouding what sounds to me like chopped piano
samples and other distorted sounds. it's uneasy, maybe even frightening to some.
the other tracks are similar in tone, always coated in this dark fogginess,
occasionally a breakbeat makes its way in but it's always filtered through this
muddy lens.

the very next thing you'll notice is how way the game looks. while the colour
choices themselves are bold, like the blues of Okay's outfit and hair, or the
hot pink floors of her building. everything from the tileset, to the
<abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr>, down to even the font to an extent looks
withered or aged, with those colours piercing through this layer of grunge.
moga's hand-drawn art here is characteristically cute and sketchy yet carries a
certain _feeling_ with it, even foregoing some of the more violent things that
happen. when a monster <q>unceremonially</q> bursts through another nurse's
stomach near the start of the game it's the type of childish depiction of
violence that can make you uncomfortable from the dissonance of it all.

Okay's need for sleep is the central focus of this game, presently obvious from
the perpetual eye bags adorning her face. she tells us <q>i can't sleep if i
know i have something to do-- ever</q> it's been 3 months since she last slept.
what it is she **needs to have done** in those 3 months we don't know just yet,
and it seems that she doesn't either somehow. we're then introduced to Gertrud,
the aforementioned floating eye thing, or apparently, Okay's only friend. the
way these two speak to each other is wrought with a familiar passive
aggressiveness. the game plants doubt to Gertrud's existence right off the bat.
Okay seems to not want to acknowledge her as anything other than some kind of
hallucination, but Gertrud disagrees; when we first meet her she coaxes Okay to
take a closer look, to touch her, feel that she is indeed real.

<!-- medical imagery -->

there's a bunch of medical imagery, which is to be expected for a game taking
place in a hospital. battles are dubbed "operations", attacks are named things
like ..., and ...,. it kind of reminds me of the
[menhera](https://menheratic.tumblr.com/nav) aesthetic and subculture a little
bit.

<!-- when i discovered and played Ghost Suburb II it was almost 10 years after its -->
<!-- initial release in <time datetime="2013">2013</time>. -->

<!-- meta -->

if we could pivot to the developer, moga has been putting their art and
creations out onto the web since even before this game's release. with games
like these it's easy to see how deeply personal they must be to their creators,
again, almost to an uncomfortable point, like you're seeing a bit too much of a
stranger (i will come back to this point soon). on a previous version moga's
site (i believe that the site at the moment is in the progress of a redesign?)
there was a link to an archive of close to their entire body of work that was
posted to Tumblr. included was folders that separated what they called the
different "phases" of their work, of which there were four. here you could see
the growth of an artist over almost a decade, the developmental periods of this
game and other earlier ones, audio files, etc. i mention this because it must be
so unbelievably vulnerable ..

<!-- i yearn to create something that makes somebody feel just a sliver of what this -->
<!-- game made me. -->
