        i'm a Canadian-based chronically online rabbit, self-taught multi-genre
        musician and producer, ADHD-haver, and game developer with amniotic band

      <p class="copy">
        a "jack of all trades" or "interdisciplinary artist" or whatever, i've
        always had a great appreciation for many kinds of art in many kinds of
        mediums as well as a love for learning and creating. you may see many
        projects with disparate tones and styles, often consecutively, but no
        matter what, my goal is always to be honest in my art, while not taking
        myself
        <em>too</em> seriously—because art should be fun after all

        i created this site initially as a simple hub for all of my projects and
        commission information , like a glorified carrd or linktree, but over
        time it's shifted to being a very personal creative outlet for me out of
        a growing frustration with the modern centralised internet and social
        media as well as the discovery of the
        <a

          >Web Revival</a
        >. i think it's as much of a creative project in of itself now as the
        works it hosts.

          >decoration</a

        because i just can't help myself!) and i try to keep the site

        compliant. i can't verify whether it's fully conformant or not so i
        won't claim it to be but i do strive to keep accessibility in mind no
        matter what creative flourishes i feel like adding! so if you have any
        issues in regards to accessibility please feel free to message me about

          The Large Blue butterfly is a species of carnivorous butterfly, and
          went extinct in Britain in 1979. It has since been reintroduced with
          new conservation methods.
