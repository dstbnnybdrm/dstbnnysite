          i try to make this site as accessible as possible because i believe
          the Web should be for everybody and that you don't necessarily have to
          sacrifice accessibility for art and creativity!

          here are some known things that could have an affect on accessibility
          (all of which i have plans to work on and improve!):
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li class="list__item">
            this site uses javascript and has not yet been tested without it
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            objects that aren't visible (such as links in a marquee that have
            gone off screen) can be focused on without being able to see them
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">a high contrast colour mode isn't provided</li>
          <li class="list__item">
            a more accessible theme isn't provided for shrines pages that aren't
            compliant
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            moving images have no options to be frozen or don't have any static
            alternatives
          </li>
        </ul>

          please <a href="/contact.html">let me know</a> if there are more or if
          any of the above is incorrect or not working as expected! i am merely
          a hobbyist web developer and am always learning so any feedback is
