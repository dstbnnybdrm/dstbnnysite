            RPG Maker games are something i only <em>really</em> got into around
            the height of the COVID-19 pandemic but have very quickly fallen in
            love with. among my very first was <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> and that
            was a special experience that i feel like you can only really have
            once; just the atmosphere, the freedom and the aimlessness, it all
            culminated into such a unique sense of comfort and escapism that i
            think i really needed at the time.
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            i got into some of the classics shortly after: games like
            <i>OFF</i>, <i>ib</i>, <i>Re:Kinder</i>, etc., all with their own
            distinct blends of horror, the surreal, and a tiny bit of
            tongue-in-cheek self awareness, yet with a paradoxically sobering
            earnestness. there's a kind of culture you can see when you play a
            number of RPG Maker games that i just that i just fell in love with
            so immediately; they can feel so intimate and so
            personal&mdash;almost to the point of feeling uncomfortably close
            sometimes&mdash;and that's not something you necessarily get a lot
            anywhere else; it's special.
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            i felt like sharing a few of my favourites and my thoughts and
            experiences with them &hearts;

          <!-- intro -->
          <p class="copy">
            i can't remember exactly how i came across this game, maybe during a
            hyperfixated binge of scrolling through games on
            <a rel="external" href="https://rpgmaker.net/">rpgmaker.net</a> or
            possibly through some article (that i can't find at the moment) that
            mentioned <a rel="external" href="">another game</a> by this
            creator, who has gone by several names online: publishing this game
            and others under
            <a
              rel="external"
              href="https://rpgmaker.net/users/CARRIONBLUE/games/"
              >CARRIONBLUE</a
            >, releasing music as
            <a rel="external" href="https://soundcloud.com/bilexth">bilexth</a>,
            and also going by moga too (at least from what i understand, and i
            myself can't knock someone for having
            <a href="/work/music.html">many aliases</a>). i'll continue to refer
            to them as moga for brevity!
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            what i can say that is that i was immediately drawn in by the game's
            long and evocative title:
            <cite
              >Ghost Suburb II: From Beyond Sleep into the Eyes of Madness</cite
            >. like, what on earth could that possibly be about? well, the
            game's description says that it's
            <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/"
              >a game about a nurse in Midland Research Hospital Center, in the
              middle of a Hospital Zone&mdash;her name is Okay. she is a
              insomniac.</q
            >
            which seems straightforward enough, until you read that
            <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/"
              >there is a friend named Gertrud, who pesters her and is a giant
              floating sphere of darkness with a eye on it</q
            >
            and that
            <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/"
              >it is highly debatable whether she is in fact a real thing.</q
            >
            well, if your interest wasn't piqued yet...
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            upon starting a new game you are immediately thrown into an ominous,
            foreboding introduction. the text that greets us as guests is skewed
            and pulses with the beat of the background music, a despondent
            voice-over begins but quickly gets lost in the dark ambiance.

            and then we're brought to our main character, Okay, who assumed that
            that was her name because that's what every has asked her for
            forever. it's a small detail but this kind of clever, darkly comedic
            writing is sprinkled everywhere throughout this game. she laments on
            being an adult, and sleep.

            the way <cite>Ghost Suburb II</cite> looks feels almost withered or
            aged, from the tilesets to the
            <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> down to even the font to an
            extent, while some of the bold colour choices, like the blues of
            Okay's character, continue to pierce through the layer of grunge
            that sits atop everything. moga's hand-drawn art here is
            characteristically cute and sketchy yet carries an uncomfortable
            feeling with it somehow; when a monster bursts through a nurse's
            stomach <q>unceremonially</q> near the start of the game, it's the
            type of illustrated violence that you might see in a child's
            notebook. it gives an air of a loss of innocence, in a way.
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            it's not a terribly well-known RPG Maker game, which i think is such
            a shame, though it has received some recognition among RPG Maker
            fans and a small, niche following.

            when i discovered and played Ghost Suburb II it was almost 10 years
            after its initial release in
            <time datetime="2013">2013</time>.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <p class="copy">
            if we could pivot to the developer, moga has been putting their art
            and creations out onto the web since even before this game's
            release. with games like these it's easy to see how deeply personal
            they must be to their creators, again, almost to an uncomfortable
            point, like you're seeing a bit too much of a stranger (i will come
            back to this point soon). on a previous version moga's site (i
            believe that the site at the moment is in the progress of a
            redesign?) there was a link to an archive of close to their entire
            body of work that was posted to Tumblr. included was folders that
            separated what they called the different "phases" of their work, of
            which there were four. here you could see the growth of an artist
            over almost a decade, the developmental periods of this game and
            other earlier ones, audio files, etc. i mention this because it must
            be so unbelievably vulnerable ..
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            i yearn to create something that makes somebody feel just a sliver
            of what this game made me.
