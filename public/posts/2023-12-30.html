# new blog, new me

<time datetime="2023-12-30">saturday, 30 december 2023</time>

it took a lot longer than i was expecting but the blog is finally up and
running! and just in time for the new year too!

this'll be a place for any random thoughts too long for twitter (not x) or
anything i feel like rambling about for an extended amount of time. ADHD
hyperfixations and whatnot.

for whatever reason i find the act of writing and making it public, even
in this very nonformal blogpost context, to be very, very vulnerable
feeling, moreso than any other forms of art i've worked in (visual, music,
etc.), so this'll also act as a form of practice and, i guess, exposure
therapy? if you can call it that lol.

in any case, i'm excited for a new outlet for expression that isn't commodified
and confined to any social media (although i _will_ probably post about this on
twitter (not x) oops); a personal lil void to throw whatever i want into. it'll
be fun! and hopefully freeing and cathartic in a way.

**note that**: if you're viewing this on some mobile/smaller screen device you
might notice there's no list or navigation for the posts themselves, and that'll
be fixed in the future! i just need to figure out a good and mobile friendly way
of implementing that since i try to make the site as accessible as i can.
