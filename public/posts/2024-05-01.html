      you can probably guess that i spend a not insignificant time sitting at a
      desk using a keyboard just about every day, i'm clearly doing it right now
      to type up this post, i'm in a Computer Science degree and it's pretty
      much
      <em>all</em> we do! so over the years i've discovered and learned ways to
      make the typing experience easier and less painful for myself (because it
      <em>has</em> been painful before!) and it's resulted in a setup that
      people tell me is pretty unusual. most of us these days probably type more
      than write, so i think it's worth talking about!

      important things out of the way first, i have amniotic band syndrome! it
      mostly affects my hands and fingers, my left hand moreso than my right.
      this makes some things designed for most people with, er, "normal" hands a
      little difficult for me to use, especially when the symmetry of both hands
      are taken into account in their design and use, which is probably most
      things that utilise both hands, keyboards included!

        i honestly didn't learn to type "properly" (i.e touch type) until just a
        few years ago. i don't exactly remember how i used to do it but i
        remember that for my left hand it relied heavily on just pinky and index
        finger and my thumb also for hitting regular keys (which is usually
        designated to just the spacebar whet touch typing). my ring finger is
        significantly shorter than what's typical and the way my middle finger
        is made using it to type was uncomfortable at first, so i didn't!
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        eventually i started to feel the years of typing like a maniac come back
        to haunt me through my wrists and it was especially bad for that left
        hand i keep bringing up. which is actually one of the issues with
        QWERTY: it doesn't distribute use between both hands, and even fingers,
        evenly. in fact, it has a bias towards the left hand where thousands of
        words are able to be typed with just the left side of the keyboard.
        maybe that's an advantage to all the lefties out there? but for me, it
        was pretty bad. since i was using just three of the five fingers on my
        left hand it put additional strain on those fingers, plus i was using my
        thumb to reach regular keys that would normally be out of reach with it
        if i was following home row, it put strain there too, especially when i
        was curling it under my hand to reach keys like Z, X, and C.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        a few years ago it started to get particularly worse, especially since
        it was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. schooling was moved
        online and so i was using a keyboard for even longer periods of time
        than i was before. i get paranoid often about losing physical abilities
        either in my hands, sight, ears, etc., and how that would affect me
        being able to work and create, so i decided it was time to finally throw
        out those bad habits and learn to touch type properly! i would have time
        anyway since this is when i took a semester off from university. i used
        a handful of resources to learn but i think one of the most helpful was
        <a rel="external" href="https://www.keybr.com/">keybr</a>, which starts
        you out with just a few letters, adding more the more you improve,
        adapting by adding more of the things you particularly struggle with,
        eventually getting to real words.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        i actually picked up touch typing pretty quickly and was a lot faster
        and a bit more comfortable than i was before. however, those issues with
        the left hand never really left, and i was still getting pains in my
        wrists. another problem with QWERTY is that it spreads out the most used
        letters across the keyboard, and largely not on the home row where your
        fingers should start in. the most used letter, E, is a row home row
        position, some of the most common consonants, T, N, S, etc. are
        scattered all across the keyboard, most of them also not on the home row
        but up and down and all over the place (and don't get me started on the
        semicolon of all things being on home row). combine this with the fact
        that so many words use the left hand primarily in QWERTY and my hands
        were still not entirely satisfied.

          the Dvorak layout
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        enter Dvorak! Dvorak is keyboard layout actually created way back in
        1934 as a more ergonomic alternative to QWERTY, aiming to address some
        of the issues with QWERTY including the ones that i'd mentioned above!
        nowadays it actually comes included with every major OS! i can imagine
        that, to someone seeing this layout for the first time, it probably
        looks like some gibberish nightmare. and for the gamers out there,
        seeing <code>,AOE</code> instead of <code>WASD</code> might've given you
        an aneurysm. but trust me, the letter placement is actually
        <em>very</em> purposeful!
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        notice that all of the vowels have now been moved to the left side of
        the keyboard. the general rule (in English) is that words have to have a
        vowel, so what this does is it ensures that pretty much every word (in
        English) requires alternating between both of your hands, splitting the
        workload and lessening the strain and fatigue put on both. notice too
        that all the vowels are right at home row, comfortably right at reach
        whenever needed. actually, most of the most common letters and letter
        combinations (bigrams) are placed at home row meaning that your fingers
        pretty much stay at home row position the majority of the time,
        significantly reducing the amount of jumping around your hands have to
        do (plus the semicolon has been moved all the way to the bottom left
        corner of the keyboard where it belongs!).

        is a really good visual aid in showing the differences in finger
        movement between QWERTY and Dvorak (and also Colemak, another
        alternative to QWERTY).
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        (a bit of an aside but i've seen people online tend to write off Dvorak.
        a common argument i see is that there's little evidence that shows that
        Dvorak significantly increases typing speed, and that's true! here's the
        thing though: speed is not the only aspect of typing. i'm not sure why
        words per minute (WPM) seems to be the most important factor to some and
        i don't think that learning Dvorak will inherently make you a faster
        typist. Dvorak, to me, is about comfort and ease, it's just that when
        the typing experience gets easier you <em>may</em> also get faster. this
        has been my experience, with QWERTY i used to peak uncomfortably at ~75
        WPM but with Dvorak i can easily reach around ~110 WPM. i'm sure that
        there are other layouts that i haven't heard of or tried that are better
        or more efficient but Dvorak is just what i've happened to stick with.
        and for what it's worth, pretty much every alternate layout i've seen is
        leagues above QWERTY!)
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        i was hesitant to learn Dvorak at first, understandably. it makes no
        attempt at easing you into it from QWERTY, unlike some other alternate
        keyboard layouts like Colemak which try to change the least amount of
        character positions, but Dvorak comes pre-installed on every OS by
        default while other alternatives don't and i didn't feel like having to
        go through the trouble of downloading a new layout every time i own a
        computer. so i took it as a fun challenge, and if it didn't pan out,
        well, i've already learned QWERTY!
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        luckily many touch type learning sites already have a mode for Dvorak,
        but if you just want to test out the waters then
        <a rel="external" href="https://learn.dvorak.nl/">learn.dvorak.nl</a>
        is a great site to use. it can handle converting the keyboard mapping
        for you so you don't need to change the layout in your system just yet.
        i used it in my first couple of weeks of trying Dvorak and after that i
        actually switched back to practicing on keybr again since it too has
        settings for Dvorak.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        the middle stages of learning a new layout can be strange feeling. at
        first i was switching back and forth between QWERTY and Dvorak, only
        really using Dvorak when practicing it, but the two started to blend
        together in my head and i'd be trying to type in one while still in the
        other. it can be kind of scary to commit to a new layout, i've heard
        accounts of people significantly losing proficiency in QWERTY after
        learning Dvorak like how you might slowly forget a language after not
        using it for a while. i took the risk though and i haven't looked back
        since, honestly! and while, yes, my ability in QWERTY has definitely
        diminished, typing has been so much more comfortable and even fun ever
        since!
      </p>

      <section class="section">
        <h4 class="subheading">part 2.2: Dvorak's issues</h4>

        <p class="blog-post__copy">
          now, as much as i've been praising Dvorak there are some caveats that
          may be deal breakers to some. one big thing is keyboard shortcuts.
          Dvorak was originally developed for typewriters, just as QWERTY was,
          so shortcuts involving modifiers keys like <code>CTRL</code> obviously
          weren't put into consideration. you'll find that a lot of shortcuts
          you used to be able to do one-handed will now have to be done with
          both hands. some common shortcuts were also only chosen because of
          their placement in QWERTY! like <code>CTRL+C</code>, which is
          intuitive by itself, C for "copy", but <code>CTRL+V</code> has no real
          semantic meaning and was only chosen to mean "paste" because V is
          right next to C on QWERTY. with Dvorak those two keys aren't even on
          the same row anymore, and possibly worse, V is actually right next to
          W now, so i find myself sometimes closing tabs and windows by accident
          with <code>CTRL+W</code> when i meant to paste.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-post__copy">
          there's also the issues with gaming. i jokingly mentioned
          <code>WASD</code> turning into <code>,AOE</code> earlier but that can
          be a legitimate problem! thankfully, a lot of mainstream games will
          actually detect when you're using Dvorak and do the remapping
          automatically (it's a pleasant surprise, too, when they even change
          the icons of keys to match the Dvorak placements!), but not every game
          does this, and if you like playing small or obscure indie games like i
          do, then you'll find that not a lot of those take that into account.
          the way i get around this is if a game doesn't support Dvorak i just
          have to switch to QWERTY using a shortcut (on Windows it's Win+Space,
          on Mac it's Control+Space), which can be a bit annoying especially if
          you're playing an online game where you have to chat with others.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-post__copy">
          there are some other common ones that i've either had little to no
          issue with or have found easy ways around but might be big deals to
          you. if you happen to use other people's keyboards often it could be a
          nightmare to have to mentally switch back and forth a lot, which isn't
          a problem for me because i don't really interact with people IRL.~
          some people find the positions of L and S to be straining on the
          pinky, i actually use my ring finger for L (P in QWERTY) which is
          technically "wrong" but from what i've seen and read it's an
          acceptable alternative! if you're a (Neo)Vim user like me you're going
          to have to get used to the new keybinding positions. i admit i was a
          bit stubborn at first and tried to get around it as i was very used to
          the HJKL positions for movement specifically, but eventually i just
          bit the bullet. the positions for movement in Dvorak are still
          relatively intuitive, splitting horizontal movement and vertical
          movement to the left and right hands respectively which some people
          might like even more. all the other Vim commands and shortcuts can be
          memorized with pretty straightforward mnemonics instead of their
          positions on the keyboard (<code>w</code> moves to the start of a
          word, <code>p</code> pastes, etc.)

      <h3 class="heading">part 3: faking an HHKB because i'm poor</h3>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        while i was experimenting with keyboard layouts i'd also developed an
        interest in mechanical keyboards, as one does. i've been gravitating
        towards smaller keyboards as i find a lot of what's on a standard
        keyboard is just kind of bloat. right now i use a 60% keyboard that was
        gifted to me by my aunt (thank you!) and have been pretty happy with it.
        though, there was one keyboard that i kept hearing mentions of,
        especially among programmers: the Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB). and it
        wasn't the fancy Topre switches that caught my attention like for it may
        have for others, but
        <a rel="external" href="https://hhkb.io/layout/">its layout</a> instead
        (the ANSI layout in particular).
      </p>

      <figure class="blog-post__figure">

          the HHKB ANSI layout
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        the HHKB was originally developed in Japan in 1996 and takes aspects
        from the original Macintosh keyboard and the Sun-3 keyboard (Sun-3 being
        a series of UNIX-based computers). what immediately captured my interest
        was the removal of the <code>CTRL</code> keys in the lower corners of
        the keyboard and instead placing it where the Caps Lock key typically
        is. i quite like this placement, it's right at home row where it's much
        more in reach making shortcuts faster and easier. the omission of so
        many other secondary keys is remedied with a small function modifier to
        the right of the right Shift key.
        <a
          rel="external"
          href="https://youtu.be/U5Nkxx0OHqg?si=ZIVU_l-xODL1pEo6"
          >this video</a
        >
        gives a pretty good overview of the keyboard and why i like it's layout
        so much.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        my current 60% keyboard doesn't have arrow keys and instead uses a
        function modifier (to the right of the right Alt key) that turns
        <code>WASD</code>
        into arrow keys, which is smart in theory since that cluster of keys is
        pretty much unanimous with movement nowadays, but in practice feels
        really clunky, especially for when you're trying to do things quickly
        since now you're using both hands instead of just one. the HHKB instead
        opts to use an unconventional combination of it's uniquely placed
        function key and the
        <code>[;,/</code> keys. with this setup you put your pinky on the
        function key and then use your index and middle fingers to access the
        arrows, all using one hand, and after getting used to it it's pretty
        natural feeling.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        i say it's natural feeling, so does that mean i've used one? well, no!
        the HHKB can be, let's say, notoriously expensive for a keyboard, so i
        wasn't getting my hands on one any time soon. but i soon found a way to
        emulate the layout and it's little quirks on my current keyboard using
        <a rel="external" href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a>,
        which is a free software that lets you write scripts to create custom
        keyboard shortcuts and macros and even automate repetitive tasks. so,
        naturally, i took a day or two to learn how to write an AutoHotkey
        script. one interesting thing i had to work around was that pretty much
        no other keyboard has that function key next to the right shift like the
        HHKB does, but since i touch type correctly i only use the right shift
        when modifying keys on the left side. this is important since pretty
        much all of the HKKB's shortcut keys happen to occur on the left side of
        the keyboard (probably to make them accessible with one hand) so i can
        just map the function key to the right shift anyway and there won't be
        any conflicts or clashes when typing. after that i just set my computer
        to open that script on startup and now i have HHKB-like shortcuts! (i
        might put it up on Github, we'll see!)
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="heading">summing up</h3>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        so that's pretty much it! i use Dvorak as an alternate keyboard layout
        to make typing more comfortable and i emulate the ease of the HHKB's
        shortcuts using AutoHotkey. i wouldn't say that you necessarily have to
        learn an alternate keyboard layout, i actually might even say the
        opposite. QWERTY <em>is</em> the de facto standard, i don't think it'll
        be going away anytime soon, and it's definitely a commitment in more
        ways than one to learn Dvorak, or any other layout. though i think that
        at the very, very least, if you haven't already, you should learn to
        touch type if you regularly interact with computers. you'll speed up,
        stop looking down, but more importantly, it's just a more ergonomic way
        of working and you'll feel much more comfortable and risk hurting
        yourself less.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-post__copy">
        hopefully i made you think a little bit about how you interact with your
        tools! they should be adapting to you and not vice versa, so don't
        hesitate to change things up, personalize them if you feel like they're
        hindering you in some way! that's all for now, take care!
