<!-- intro -->

i can't remember exactly how i came across this game, maybe during a
hyperfixated binge of scrolling through games on
[rpgmaker.net](https://rpgmaker.net/) or possibly through some article (that i
can't find at the moment) that mentioned [another game]() by this creator, who
has gone by several names online: publishing this game and others under
[CARRIONBLUE](https://rpgmaker.net/users/CARRIONBLUE/games/), releasing music as
[bilexth](https://soundcloud.com/bilexth), and also going by moga at the same
time, at least from what i understand. but i'll continue to refer to them as
moga for brevity!

what ultimately led me to check out the game was its long and evocative title:
<cite>Ghost Suburb II: From Beyond Sleep into the Eyes of Madness</cite>, which
immediately brings to mind a bunch of questions. well, the game's description
says that it's <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">a game about a nurse
in Midland Research Hospital Center, in the middle of a Hospital Zone&mdash;her
name is Okay. she is a insomniac.</q> which seems straightforward enough, until
you read that <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">there is a friend named
Gertrud, who pesters her and is a giant floating sphere of darkness with a eye
on it</q> and that <q cite="https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/">it is highly
debatable whether she is in fact a real thing.</q> well, if your interest wasn't
piqued yet...

upon starting a new game you are immediately thrown into an ominous, foreboding
introduction. the text that greets us as guests is skewed and pulses with the
beat of the background music, a despondent voice-over begins but quickly gets
lost in the dark ambiance.

and then we're brought to our main character, Okay, who assumed that that was
her name because that's what every has asked her for forever. it's a small
detail but this kind of clever, darkly comedic writing is sprinkled everywhere
throughout this game. she laments on being an adult, and sleep.

<!-- visual -->

one of the first things i noticed about <cite>Ghost Suburb II</cite> is the the
way the game looks almost withered or aged, from the tilesets to the
<abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr>, down to even the font to an extent. the
bold colour choices, like the blues of Okay's character, piercing through the
layer of grunge that sits atop everything. moga's hand-drawn art here is
characteristically cute and sketchy yet carries an uncomfortable feeling with it
somehow; when a monster bursts through a nurse's stomach <q>unceremonially</q>
near the start of the game it's the type of illustrated violence that you might
see in a child's notebook. it gives an air of a loss of innocence.

there's also the game's heavy use of medical imagery, which is to be expected of
a game taking place in a hospital. .... it kind of reminds me of the
[menhera](https://menheratic.tumblr.com/nav) aesthetic and subculture.

it's not a terribly well-known RPG Maker game, which i think is such a shame,
though it has received some recognition among RPG Maker fans and a small, niche
following.

when i discovered and played Ghost Suburb II it was almost 10 years after its
initial release in <time datetime="2013">2013</time>.

<hr />

if we could pivot to the developer, moga has been putting their art and
creations out onto the web since even before this game's release. with games
like these it's easy to see how deeply personal they must be to their creators,
again, almost to an uncomfortable point, like you're seeing a bit too much of a
stranger (i will come back to this point soon). on a previous version moga's
site (i believe that the site at the moment is in the progress of a redesign?)
there was a link to an archive of close to their entire body of work that was
posted to Tumblr. included was folders that separated what they called the
different "phases" of their work, of which there were four. here you could see
the growth of an artist over almost a decade, the developmental periods of this
game and other earlier ones, audio files, etc. i mention this because it must be
so unbelievably vulnerable ..

i yearn to create something that makes somebody feel just a sliver of what this
game made me.
