      i got my very first electric guitar sometime in, i think, 2017 on my
      birthday: a cheap, black and white Squier Stratocaster (the only
      left-handed model in our price-range they had at the time) with a used
      Line VI Spider amp, i still have both to this day! since then i've
      accumulated a not-insignificant amount of instruments, toys, and other
      oddities i've managed to get my hands on (maybe i'll write about all of
      those sometime). but the topic for this particular post are my electric
      guitars! i've gotten two more since then: my trusty Fender Telecaster,
      tentatively named "Sunny," and my recent love, my Squire Classic Vibe
      Mustang "Langley."
    </p>

    <p>
      i've gotten <em>a lot</em> of use out of those two instruments in the past
      few years, but every once in a while i feel the weight of my neglect for
      that very first electric guitar. admittedly the electronics on it can
      leave a little (or a lot) to be desired and so i never felt the need to
      use it for recording since the other two guitars suited my purposes a
      little bit better. but since i had it i felt like i needed to at least try
      and find a purpose for it; maybe give it some sort of a niche that i don't
      currently have filled.

    <p>
      the first of my experiments with my Squire Strat was trying out some
      tuning shenanigans. i had just gotten into <i>Sonic Youth</i> at the time
      and figured i had a safe candidate to try out their tunings on. the one i
      stuck with for a while was the tuning for my fav
      <abbr title="Sonic Youth">SY</abbr> song, <i>Schizophrenia</i>: 
      <pre>F#F#GGAA</pre>.
      it just has this strange, dissonant, but ethereal quality to it that i
      loved. of course, you can't just tune a regular set of guitar strings to
      this--well i guess you can but you'd lose like half of your strings--so i
      opted to use the closest gauge counterparts that i had lying around: 2 low
      E's, 2 A's, and 2 G's (note that i had to file down the nut slots to do
      this, so proceed with caution if you want to try it; you can't undo
      filing!). i left Ramiel like this for a bit and even recorded a DREAM
      DISPHORIA song with it (tunings like this are great for stuff like noise,
      drone, ambient, etc.!).
    </p>

    <p>
      one cool unintended thing about the Schizophrenia tuning is that it's very
      close to being an "Ostrich tuning," or a "trivial tuning," one where all
      the strings are the same note. as much as i liked the dreamy vibe of the
      Schizophrenia tuning i found i that i couldn't find many uses for it, and
      would end up leaving Ramiel untouched for extended periods of timd again.
      eventually after fiddling around with the strings for a bit i just left it
      in a trivial G tuning (i.e GGGggg, lmao). as silly as it might look,
      giving myself less notes right off the bat made this guitar more useful to
      me somehow. i like the way Yvette Young describes guitar tunings, that
      they each kind of "colour" the sound in their own way, so in the case of
      Ostrich tuning i think of it as like a monochrome palette. i used it to
      add these super jangly and drone-y overdubs to some songs by capo-ing at
      whatever would get me at the song's key and just fretting a couple strings
      at the root notes and letting the rest ring out. if we're still using this
      colour analogy i guess it'd be like applying a colour filter on top of the
      song or a blending mode.
    </p>

    <p>
      now, you may have guessed, but Ostrich tuning can be a bit limiting to say
      the least lol. while it was fun for a bit to try and work within the
      boundaries of this tuning, there's only so much you can do, and more
      importantly i felt like it was making Ramiel a guitar purely for overdubs,
      and never just playing her on her own. which can't be right! Ramiel is her
      own guitar! i just needed to find another purpose for her.

    <p>
      enter experiment number two! one day i put on a youtube video by david
      hilowitz (creator of decentsampler!) where he finds and restores a super
      decrepit guitar and turns it into a "basitar." he goes into it in the
      video, but basically, a regular six string electric guitar but with two
      bass strings instead, used by one of the guys in the Presidents of the
      United States of America. i loved how it sounded and the guitar in the
      video being a black strat-style guitar gave me an idea. so i stripped all
      the strings (insert stripping off G-string joke) off of Ramiel and took
      the 2 highest strings off of my bass guitar (the d and g strings). the
      basitar is a very niche concept, so there isn't really a lot of
      information on it or how to set one up, no where does it say to use the D
      and G strings of a bass, but i approximated it with the closest that i had
      to what i think are the gauges that Chris of POTUS uses.
    </p>

    <p>
      (since we're talking about information online, i did see a lot of people
      saying not to do this lol. that it would destroy the neck of the guitar,
      warp it from the tension, etc. ... but i'll be honest i do think that
      people tend to overreact a little when it comes to guitar setup,
      adjustments, and modifications. modern guitars are a lot more resilient
      than some might think! now, i still wouldn't recommend trying much of what
      i'm doing here, especially if it's your first time doing any of these
      adjustments, but if you think you know what you're doing and have some
      knowledge under your belt then i say go right ahead!)
    </p>

    <p>
      pretty much every instance i've seen of chris's basitar or other people's
      imitations were the bass strings being in the A and G string positions of
      the guitar. my guess is it's counteracts the larger thickness of the
      strings so they wouldn't be too close together and more like a bass
      guitars string distance. after just slapping the strings on i was
      surprised at how well Ramiel took the much higher gauges. they were pretty
      much playable immediately, to a certain extent , and with some simple
      adjustments she was a pretty decent playing guitar! or, uh, basitar! the
      filed-down nut slots i had already done for the SY tuning were actually
      already pretty close to what i needed for these new strings to fit snug.
      the way bass strings feel on a standard six string guitar is also
      surprisingly different. the shorter scale-length makes frets easier to
      reach of course, but there's a kind of "thumpiness" (?) there that i love
      and kind of reminds me of, say, a fender mustang bass. the tuning i went
      with was DA (same as POTUS but they tuned a half-step lower) so it
      actually occupies the same range as a normal guitar in drop D, but the
      bigger string gauges give the sound so much more weight and heaviness, it
      feels lower even though i know it's technically not.

      i loved how it felt and sounded and how it was just limiting enough to
      feel creative in without being too stifling. one of the things i like
      about bass strings is that, to me, it feels a lot easier to tap on them. i
      guess something about the larger gauges makes them easier to ring out when
      tapped, and this applies to the basitar as well! but tapping got me
      thinking about twinkly emo and math rock (well, i guess i'm always
      thinking about twinkly emo), and that gave me another idea. what if i add
      just one more string? a high one, so i could get an interesting
      juxtaposition between the meaty low notes and also some twinkly high
      stuff. so i took an extra high E string i had and strung it in the B
      position. i tried it in the actual high E position first, and it
      definitely worked, but i actually preferred the closer proximity to the A
      string. since the D and A strings are now one whole string apart, if the E
      and A strings are closer you can actually fret both of them with a barre.
      and since E and A are a fifth apart you get a power chord really easily
      without touching the D string (and of course, D and A also make a power
      chord, so there's two ways to get power chords here!). i left the high E
      string as an E note so now the tuning is DAe, coincidentally half of the
      famous American Football tuning: DAEac#e. i love emo. so in effect i
      basically took the already niche idea of a basitar and altered it even
      more to fit my personal needs. i'm pretty sure i'm the only person to have
      tried this particular setup, at least from looking around online.

      i've always operated under the assumption that when i buy a guitar, or any
      instrument, it's mine to keep forever. i've always found it kind of stupid
      that as soon as you make the tiniest change to your instrument the resale
      value plummets to oblivion. i think you should make your instruments
      unabashedly yours! mod them, do whatever is gonna connect you to your
      instrument more and make it easier to express yourself on them. it's why i
      cover my instruments in stickers and give them silly names and do all
      sorts of stuff to them.
