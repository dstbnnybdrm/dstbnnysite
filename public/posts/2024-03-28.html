        man, this month has been surprisingly exhausting as everything is
        starting to wrap up this semester! i'm typically pretty bad at keeping
        up with habits during busy times like this so i haven't given myself
        many opportunities to write a lot. i know, ironic considering my last
        post was about rest!
      </p>

      <p>
        i got older some time this month! my mom kept asking me if i wanted to
        do anything special for it but i'm not usually one for grand, bustling
        celebrations and stuff like that, so it was just a relatively chill day;
        we ate out, my dad and i spontaneously bought a ukulele banjo when we
        were only meant to get guitar strings lol.
      </p>

      <p>
        i've been wanting an actual banjo for a while, i think it's a beautiful
        instrument with a rich history, but the ukulele banjo is close behind
        (and cheaper!) and has its own qualities that set it apart from both a
        ukulele and a banjo. it's been fun toying around with that thing, it has
        a unique timbre i've never really had access to before, so it's been
        interesting trying to incorporate it into my songwriting.
      </p>

      <p>
        other than that, i added a
        <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">/now</a>page to the site, inspired
        by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a>! i really liked the
        concept: a high level, bigger picture look at your life, currently. if
        we have pages <a href="/?=p/about/">about</a>ourselves personally then
        why not a page about how we've been lately? so that's there now, and
        it'll be updated every once in a while!
      </p>

      <p>
        i'm also currently reworking my
        <a href="/hub?p=/about/interests">interests</a>
        page to be it's own thing and have its own sub-pages and stuff so i'll
        have more room to ramble on about the things i love and hyperfixate
        over! it'll be fun. i've been trying to think of an interesting, quirky
        name for it other than just "interests" but that's what it is right now
        lol. i've also been throwing around ideas for a landing page and
        possibly rearranging and adding some stuff to the main layout, but
        knowing myself, if i don't keep at things one at a time then nothing'll
        get finished, so that's my current focus for now on the site!
      </p>

      <p>
        i've also been trying to improve at poetry-writing in particular. it's a
        bit difficult because poetry can be, to me, an especially
        vulnerable-feeling medium, and at the same time it can be really easy to
        sound (and i don't like using this word often, but) cringe, to say the
        least. my writing also tends to lean towards being a little macabre and
        surreal, which can be hard for me to judge objectively, if that makes
        any sense. but it's something i really want to get better at, because it
        can be a very powerful and moving medium, and i really do love writing
        despite how embarrassing it still feels.
      </p>

      <p>
        that should be it for now, mostly. there's not much else notable going
        on, just trying to make it through this semester, and going into details
        there would be <em>very</em> boring and probably amount to just a list
        of complaints. so i hope this month has been good to you, and if not, i
        hope the next will be better! take care, you deserve it! here's a little
        audio doodle i recorded the other day:
