        <h2>i hung my memories (aug - oct 2022)</h2>
        <p>dada poems made out of fragments of many personal writings from around 2017-2020.
        <p>putting all the old writings i could find, from memos on my phone, to forgotten google doc pages,
          into a single document and randomly shuffling the words around with a generator, i try to find
          some kind of meaning out of the result, cutting and stitching together whole phrases and
          pieces of nonsense sentences.

          <p>i never changed like you did. time shoved months out of me.
            my radio waves break and <br>
            messages fall out. despite this you'll
            think the same words, keeping the same letters,<br>
            almost as if you and i were writing on trees.

            i would sleep at 15,<br>
            staring,<br>
            leaving lines from the waves above.
          <p>never will they know<br>
            when summer's chemicals<br>
            paint flowerbed seasons<br>

          <p>you didn’t like that i said<br>
          the months had nothing.
          <p>i realise now<br>
            the past<br>
            had everything:<br>

          <p>your wonder.
          <p>Time had thought it taxing<br>
            and said, <em>haste, don’t talk.<br>
            had your heart been ready<br> 
            your character of staying stuck<br>

            a hope too used out.<br>
            i lit apart on why, at last,<br>
            everything about us seemed crowded.
          <p>small; i feel it but none was felt.<br>
