    <h2 class="title">RPG Maker</h2>

    <p class="body-copy">
      RPG Maker games are something i only <em>really</em> got into around the
      height of the COVID-19 pandemic but have very quickly fallen in love with.
      among my very first was "Yume Nikki" and that was a special experience
      that i feel like you can only really have once; just the atmosphere, the
      freedom and the aimlessness, it all culminated into such a unique sense of
      comfort and escapism that i think i really needed at the time.
    </p>

    <p class="body-copy">
      i got into some of the classics shortly after: games like "OFF", "ib",
      "Re:Kinder", etc., all with their own unique blends of horror, the
      surreal, and a tiny bit of tongue-in-cheek self awareness, yet with a
      paradoxically sobering earnestness. there's a kind of culture you can see
      when you play a number of RPG Maker games that i just that i just fell in
      love with so immediately; they can feel so intimate and
      personal&mdash;almost to the point of feeling uncomfortably close
      sometimes&mdash;and that's not something you necessarily get a lot
      anywhere else.
    </p>

    <p class="body-copy">
      i felt like sharing a few of my favourites and some words to go along with
      them!

        it's truly difficult to put into words anything that hasn't been said
        before about this game. i think the easiest and only complete way to get
        a sense of it is to simply
        <a
          rel="external"
          href="https://yumenikki.fandom.com/wiki/Yume_Nikki#Yume_Nikki"
          target="_top"
          >experience it for yourself</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p class="body-copy">
        Yume Nikki seemed to have just popped suddenly into existence in 2004,
        its last official update happening about 3 years later, and with little
        heard from the game's developer, KIKIYAMA, since. and i think the
        mysteries surrounding Yume Nikki's creator, coupled with its atmosphere
        and the subject matter itself, adds to the allure and mystique of the
        game for a lot of people; by its very nature there are open ends
        everywhere in almost every aspect of this game and it's so fascinating
        to dig through.
      </p>

      <p class="body-copy">
        at first glance it's probably unclear why this game has had such an
        impact on people. when i tell my uninitiated friends about Yume Nikki i
        tell them that it's a game about walking around and exploring a dream
        world,
        <em>and that's it</em>. i make sure to explicitly say that there is no
        "goal" in the traditional sense, save for collecting all the "effects"
        and subsequently achieving the ending, which are both entirely optional.
        but, to me, that's <em>why</em> Yume Nikki is so special and why it's
        achieved the devoted following that it has. there's a particularly
        unique blend of emotions in the game's aimlessness: some parts
        comforting, some uneasy; some parts familiar, some totally alien.
        there's so much that's unexplained but that you know must mean
        <em>something</em>, right? like you've been dropped into somebody's
        subconscious (and, in a way, you have).
      </p>

      <p class="body-copy">
        that open-endedness and lack of direction lends itself to being a deeply
        personal experience for each person that plays it, and is why i
        personally would recommend playing it completely blind, at least for the
        first time. people discover new areas in different orders, find things
        in different ways, interpret things differently. it's a joy watching
        somebody play this game and seeing how much their experience differed
        from yours. it almost acts like a Rorschach test in a way: what you take
        away from it is individual to your subjective experiences; different
        things will imprint more onto different people. there's a number of fan
        theories regarding what exactly is happening and what is trying to be
        said, if anything, sprouting from recurring bits of imagery and general
        themes that people have picked up on.
      </p>

      <p class="body-copy">
        to me, Yume Nikki embodies a strange kind of comfort that's hard to
        articulate, maybe because i played it during a particularly vulnerable
        time. something about having an entire world to explore at my own pace,
        nothing expected of me, . there were a lot of moments that caught me off
        guard with their emotional resonance.
      </p>

        there's a traincar you can find that takes you from one area to another.

          >misconstrued as a horror game</a
        >
        often. it certainly isn't the most optimistic game, at least at a
        surface level. there's a heavy weight of isolation as you explore this
        world on your own, areas like the Number World that feel almost hostile,
        and moments that can be
        <a rel="external" href="">genuinely unsettling</a>, but to label it
        "horror" feels like a huge undercut, in my opinion. Yume Nikki can be
        scary in the same way it can be scary to be alone with your own
        thoughts; the frightening aspects feel less like The Point and more like
        a natural outcome to the surreal, free associative nature of the game.
