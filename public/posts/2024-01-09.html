# here we go again!

<time  datetime="2024-01-09">tuesday, 09 january 2024</time>

today was my first day returning to university, woo. last year i decided to take
a semester off because the previous one had burnt me out in a way that i've
never really experienced before in academia, it kind of took me by surprise. i
figured i'd use that new free time as an opportunity work more on my craft and
develop some my creative projects.

some of that material i ended up actually finishing and releasing too!
<cite>intrusyve thotz</cite> off my project DREAM DISPHORIA was one of those as
well as the redesign of this site! i'll admit though, it _does_ still feel like
i wasn't able to get everything i wanted finished by the time the new semester
rolled around. maybe i was a bit too ambitious, but also, i'm constantly jotting
ideas down and getting excited over new ones; by the time a project is finished
there's usually something new for me to work on right after.

(as an aside i just want to say i'm very, very grateful to all the positive
reception that the DREAM DISPHORIA project has gotten and for all the kind
things people have said! it hasn't gotten huge or anything but i'm used to
throwing these things into the void with no fanfare, and while i don't
necessarily mind that it's always nice to see people enjoy something you've
created)

despite that i don't even think i ended up relaxing that much over the break
either lol. it felt like i had a clock over me the whole time, so i got it in my
head that i needed to spend as much time as possible scrambling, trying to
finish whatever i could until it was up. maybe that's a bit overdramatic (most 
definitely). i do wish i gave myself a lot more breathing room though. allowing
yourself the time to consume and digest art is as important to being an artist
and creator as the act of creating itself is, and this is a balance i've always
kind of struggled with getting right. i think i was consuming the most art when
i was going through a huge creative block a couple years ago.

but not to make this whole thing to just a long list of pretentious artist
complaints! i'm still chipping away at my next album, which'll be more of a
traditional rock-y, guitar-based thing, and i might actually have some new,
weird DREAM DISPHORIA material to release in the meantime (emphasis on
_might_!). still always excited to be working on stuff!

anyway, here's a short audio doodle i haphazardly cobbled together the other
night:
