      around <time datetime="2024-08">August of 2024</time> i got the news that
      my family and i would have to be moving house around the end of the next
      month. it felt pretty sudden, honestly! (though i obviously won’t be
      divulging into the details). we’d been living in that house for around
      3-ish years and weren’t expecting to have to move for at least a few more.
      we’ve spent a lot of time and effort making that house feel like our own;
      i spent a lot of time building up a creative space in my room (dubbed the
      “bnnystudio”) that would let creating feel as fun and effortless as i
      could make it.

      but, of course, life happens and there’s not much to do about it other
      than roll with the punches! i thought i’d put down a few experiences and
      thoughts on it:
    </p>

    <section class="l-stack" id="boxes">
      <h2>boxes</h2>

      <p>
        it’s pretty cliché to say, but yeah, you really don’t realize how much
        stuff you have until you have to put them all into fixed-size cardboard
        boxes. i always thought of myself as somebody that doesn’t have a ton of
        superfluous stuff (i like finding ways of working with what i have, DIY
        ’til i die mindset!) but as it turns out, i apparently like to hold onto
        things: really old Christmas and birthday cards from people i haven’t
        talked to in years, electronics that don’t even really work but i swear
        i can figure out how to fix, literal, actual rocks. figuring out what’s
        worth keeping and what isn’t was a surprisingly a painful process, and
        not even because of whatever emotional attachment i have to these
        things, but just having to sift through the sheer amount of everything
        and figuring out where to start and stop, ADHD, executive dysfunction
        shenanigans, blah blah.
      </p>

      <p>
        one thing i didn’t account for, stupidly lmao, was the weight that these
        boxes were going to be, as it was going to be <em>me</em>, my dad, and
        just a few family members and friends helping out and moving stuff into
        and out of a van. i never really thought about it in passing, but books?
        heavy. like, as fuck lol. i like keeping like-things together in the
        same space since it helps me with remembering where things are but that
        meant that i threw <em>all</em> of the books i owned into one box. same
        thing happened with all of the vinyl records our family’s collected: all
        packed up in one box. and vinyl? heavy. as fuck.
      </p>

      <p>
        after having moved all of our boxes into the van we drove straight to
        the new place to immediately start moving them back out again. it’s
        weird how annoying that felt, since this was the whole point, moving the
        stuff from here to there, but it kind of felt like we were undoing all
        the hard work of carrying things into the van and practicing Tetris-like
        skills to try and fit as much as possible in that space, in a funny,
        non-serious kind of way, of course.

      <h2>ouchies</h2>

      <p>
        one thing about the new house itself is it’s a bit more “stair-heavy”
        than our previous, and actually right at the front door there’s already
        flight of stairs to get to the rest of the house. moving heavy boxes on
        their own is one thing, having to move them
        <em>up stairs</em> is definitely another. the feeling after it was all
        over and everything was now in the house was a weird mix of satisfaction
        and bittersweetness, like those scenes in movies where they say “welp!
        there’s no going back now!”
      </p>

      <p>
        the days following were expectedly SORE. even though the initial day of
        arrival felt like such a success, there was still
        <em>a lot</em> more to do, because things in boxes have to eventually
        turn into things that are no longer in boxes, and some of those boxes
        would have to be brought up even more stairs to reach the rooms they
        were meant for. so i took a day off from school work to handle the brunt
        of this. my entire body hurt the whole time, but that was to be expected
        from all the work from the previous day—i’m not exactly the most active
        person in the world lol.
      </p>

      <p>
        turns out, days later, i got sick! probably from hauling boxes around in
        the rain (yeah, Mother Nature decided it was a good day to start raining
        lmao). moreover, in the following days where i started recovering from
        my sickness, i noticed that i was still feeling a very specific kind of
        pain in my leg, which was <em>very</em> apparent when walking down
        stairs. eventually, i learned that i had gotten IT band syndrome (yay!),
        most definitely from the strenuous activity from moving day, and
        especially because of the damn stairs lol. walking to and from classes
        on those days was quite the pain, and on days off i learned how to DIY
        an ice pack with a plastic bag, water, some rubbing alcohol to help
        along the healing process. maybe about 2–3 weeks later was when my leg
        became fully functional again, and i’d like to keep it that way from
        here on out lol; that period <em>sucked</em>.

      <p>
        it’s been a full semester since having moved in now! i initially told
        myself that, while i’d be focusing more on my studies this time around,
        i’d still occasionally update this site and blog, but it looks like i’m
        <em>very</em> bad at multi-tasking lmao. i actually started writing this
        sometime last month but then got sidetracked. at the very least though,
        i did notice an improvement in academic performance and also a lot less
        stress from trying to juggle both creative projects <em>and</em> school
        work at the same time. i’ll probably always be at least a little
        disappointed that i can’t work on everything, always, and at the same
        time, but i think i’m learning to plan and prioritize a bit more.
      </p>

      <p>
        i’m bad at ending these types of “life update” posts lol. i hope
        <em>you’re</em> doing well and that your holidays have been good! here’s
        a demo i made in the time away from this site. take care!
