        <p class="copy">hi, you can call me jp!</p>

        <p class="copy">
          i'm a chronically online rabbit, self-taught multi-genre musician and
          producer, ADHD-haver, and game developer with amniotic band syndrome!
          i'm always pursuing a variety of creative endeavours!
        </p>

        <p class="copy">
          a "jack of all trades" or "interdisciplinary artist" or whatever, i've
          always had a great appreciation for many kinds of art in many kinds of
          mediums as well as a love for learning and creating. you may see many
          projects with disparate tones and styles, often consecutively, but no
          matter what, my goal is always to be honest in my art, while not
          taking myself
          <em>too</em> seriously—because art should be fun after all

            The Large Blue butterfly is a species of carnivorous butterfly, and
            went extinct in Britain in 1979. It has since been reintroduced with
            new conservation methods.

          i created this site initially as a simple hub for all of my projects
          and commission information kind of like a glorified carrd or linktree,
          but over time it's shifted to being a very personal creative outlet
          for me, partly out of a growing frustration with social media and the
          modern centralised internet as a whole as well as the discovery of the
          <a
            rel="external"

            >Web Revival</a
          >
          and other adjacent terms/movements. now i think it's as much of a
          creative project in and of itself.

          this site is <em>roughly</em> following the principles of

            >decoration</a

          compliant. i can't verify whether it's fully conformant or not so i
          won't claim it to be but i do strive to keep accessibility in mind no
          matter what creative flourishes i feel like adding! so if you have any
          issues in regards to accessibility please feel free to
