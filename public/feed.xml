    <content type="text">
        i updated the media section of my /now page! and also created this
        feed! what makes it different from the site-log on the site? well, i
        plan to put blog posts here and also bigger updates, more-so site 
        additions, while the site-log is going to continue being very
        granular in its content! stuff you'd probably want to be notified
        about and not, like, me fixing a dumb CSS mistake i missed a month
        ago lol.
