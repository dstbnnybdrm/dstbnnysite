      i got my very first electric guitar sometime in, i think, 2017 on my
      birthday: a cheap, black and white Squier Stratocaster (the only
      left-handed model in our price-range they had at the time) with a used
      Line VI Spider amp, i still have both to this day! since then i've
      accumulated a not-insignificant amount of instruments, toys, and other
      oddities i've managed to get my hands on (maybe i'll write about all of
      those sometime). but the topic for this particular post are my electric
      guitars! i've gotten two more since then: my trusty Fender Telecaster,
      tentatively named "Sunny," and my recent love, my Squier Classic Vibe
      Mustang "Langley."

      i've gotten <em>a lot</em> of use out of those two instruments in the past
      few years, but every once in a while i feel the weight of my neglect for
      that very first electric guitar, whom i've now named "Ramiel." admittedly
      the electronics on it can leave a little to be desired and so i never felt
      the need to use it for recording since the other two guitars usually
      suited my purposes a little bit better. but since i had it i felt like i
      needed to at least try and find a purpose for it; maybe give it some sort
      of a niche that i don't currently have filled.
    </p>

    <h3 class="blog-post__heading">experiment 01: tunings</h3>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      the first of my experiments with my Squier Strat was trying out some
      tuning shenanigans. i had just gotten into <i>Sonic Youth</i> at the time
      and figured i had a safe candidate to try out their tunings on. the one i
      stuck with for a while was the tuning for my fav
      <i><abbr title="Sonic Youth">SY</abbr></i> song, <i>Schizophrenia</i>:
      <code class="blog-post__code">F#F#GGAA</code>. it has this strange,
      dissonant, almost ethereal quality to it that i love. of course, you can't
      just tune a regular set of guitar strings to this—well, i guess you can
      but you'd lose like half of your strings lol—so i opted to use the closest
      gauge counterparts that i had lying around from a standard set: 2 low E's,
      2 A's, and 2 G's (note that i had to file down the nut slots to do this,
      so proceed with caution if you want to try it!). i left it like this for a
      bit and even recorded a dark ambient
      <a
        href="https://dustbunnybedroom.bandcamp.com/track/complete-dyssociation-we-never-needed-this-body-anyways"
        target="_blank"
        >DREAM DISPHORIA song</a
      >
      with it (esoteric tunings like this are great for stuff like noise, drone,
      ambient, etc.!).
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      one cool unintended thing about the <i>Schizophrenia</i> tuning is that
      it's very close to being an "Ostrich tuning," or a "trivial tuning," one
      where all the strings are all tuned to the same note. as much as i liked
      the dreamy vibe of the <i>Schizophrenia</i> tuning i found that i couldn't
      find that many uses for it, its particular dissonance was hard to fit into
      many contexts, and would end up leaving the guitar untouched for extended
      periods of time again. eventually after fiddling around with the strings
      again i ended up just left it in a trivial G tuning,
      <code class="blog-post__code">GGGggg</code>. as silly as it might look,
      giving myself less notes right off the bat made this guitar
      <em>more</em> useful to me somehow. i like the way Yvette Young describes
      guitar tunings, that they each kind of "colour" the sound in their own
      way, in this case i think of it as kind of like a monochrome palette. i
      used it to add these super jangly and drone-y overdubs to some songs by
      capo-ing at whatever would get me at the song's key and just fretting a
      couple strings at the root notes and letting the rest ring out. if we're
      still using this colour analogy i guess it'd be like applying a colour
      filter on top of the song or a blending mode of some sort.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      now, you may have guessed, but Ostrich tuning can be a little bit limiting
      to say the least lol. while it was fun for a bit to try and work within
      the boundaries of this tuning, there's only so much you can do, and i felt
      like it was making the guitar purely one for overdubs, which can't be
      right!

      >!) where he finds and restores a super decrepit guitar and turns it into
      a "basitar." he goes into it in the video, but basically, a regular six
      string electric guitar but with two bass strings instead, used famously by
      Chris Ballew of the <i>Presidents of the United States of America</i>. i
      loved how it sounded and the guitar in the video being a black Strat-style
      guitar like mine gave me an idea. i stripped off all the strings (insert
      G-string joke) and took the 2 highest strings off of my bass guitar (the D
      and G strings). the basitar is a very niche concept, so there isn't really
      a lot of information on it or how to set one up. i don't think anyone
      really says to use the D and G strings of a bass (instead most people
      really just said not to do it at all lol), but i approximated it with what
      i had compared to what i think are the gauges that Ballew of
      <i
        ><abbr title="Presidents of the United States of America"
          >POTUS</abbr
        ></i
      >
      uses (he might have used baritone strings instead, if i recall).
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      pretty much every instance i've seen of Ballew's basitar, or other
      people's imitations, had the bass strings being in the A and G string
      positions of the guitar, i.e skipping one string in-between. my guess is
      that it counteracts the larger thickness of the strings so they wouldn't
      be too close together and more like a bass guitars string distance. after
      just slapping the strings onto the guitar i was surprised at how well it
      took the much higher gauges. they were pretty much playable immediately,
      to a certain extent, and with some simple adjustments it was a pretty
      decent playing guitar! or, uh, basitar! the filed-down nut slots i had
      already done for the SY tuning were actually already pretty close to what
      i needed for these new strings to fit snug. the way bass strings feel on a
      standard six string guitar is also surprisingly different. the shorter
      scale-length makes frets easier to reach, of course, but there's a kind of
      extra "thumpiness" (?) there that i love and kind of reminds me of, say, a
      Fender Mustang bass. the tuning i went with was
      <code class="blog-post__code">DA</code> (half-step higher from what
      <i>POTUS</i> used) so it actually occupies the same range as a normal
      guitar in drop D, but the bigger string gauges give the sound much more
      weight and also kind of counteracts the thinner sounding electronics. i
      loved how it felt and sounded and how it was just limiting enough to feel
      creative in without being <em>too</em> stifling!

    <h3 class="blog-post__heading">experiment 03: Ramiel</h3>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      one of the things i like about bass strings is that, to me, it feels a lot
      easier to tap on them. i guess something about the larger gauges makes
      them easier to ring out when tapped? and this applies to the basitar as
      well! but then that got me thinking about twinkly emo and math rock (well,
      i guess i'm always thinking about twinkly emo and math rock), and then
      <em>that</em> gave me another idea. what if i add just one more string? a
      regular unwound guitar string, so i could some interesting juxtaposition
      between the meaty low bass string sound and also some twinkly high stuff.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      so i took an extra high E string i had and strung it in the B position,
      right next to the (now) A string. i tried it in the actual high E position
      first, and it definitely worked, but i actually preferred the closer
      proximity to the A string. since the D and A strings are further apart, if
      the high E and A strings are closer you can actually fret both of them
      with a barre without touching the low D. and since E and A are a fifth
      apart you get a power chord really easily without touching the D string
      (and of course, D and A also make a power chord, so there's two ways to
      get two very different sounding power chords here!). i left the high E
      string as an E, so now the tuning is:

      tuning: <code class="blog-post__code">DAEac#e</code>. man, i love emo. at
      this point was when i named the guitar "Ramiel" (don't ask me why, i'm not
      even entirely sure lol).

      in effect, i basically took the already niche idea of a basitar and
      altered it even more to fit my personal needs, and i might be the only
      person to have tried this particular setup? at least from looking around
      online, i'm sure <em>somebody</em> out there has to have done something
      similar.

    <p class="blog-post__copy">
      i've always operated under the assumption that when i buy a guitar, or any
      instrument, it's mine to keep forever. there's obviously times where you
      might need to sell one, but i never really operate under the assumption
      that i will some day, so i don't worry about things like how the resell
      value gets affected by doing X or Y to one. i think you should make your
      instruments unabashedly yours! cover them in stickers, give them silly
      names, do all sorts of weird stuff and modifications to them, as long as
      you know what you're doing, whatever is gonna connect you to your
      instrument more and make it easier to express yourself on them!
