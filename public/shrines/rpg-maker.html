            RPG Maker games are something i only <em>really</em> got into around
            the height of the COVID-19 pandemic but have very quickly fallen in
            love with. among my very first wa <cite>Yume Nikki</cite> and that
            was a special experience that i feel like you can only really have
            once; just the atmosphere, the freedom and the aimlessness, it all
            culminated into such a unique sense of comfort and escapism that i
            think i really needed at the time.
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            i got into some of the classics shortly after: games like
            <i>OFF</i>, <i>ib</i>, <i>Re:Kinder</i>, etc., all with their own
            distinct blends of horror, the surreal, and a tiny bit of
            tongue-in-cheek self awareness, yet with a paradoxically sobering
            earnestness. there's a kind of culture you can see when you play a
            number of RPG Maker games that i just that i just fell in love with
            so immediately; they can feel so intimate and so
            personal&mdash;almost to the point of feeling uncomfortably close
            sometimes&mdash;and that's not something you necessarily get a lot
            anywhere else; it's special.
          </p>

            i felt like sharing a few of my favourites and my thoughts and
            experiences with them &hearts;
